In 2022, The NIDDK of NIH funded the creation of an Analysis, Technology, Leadership, Administration and Science (ATLAS) Center with the overarching goal of building the "go-to" open-access resource for the research community of mouse and human renal and genitourinary development and disease.

The ATLAS-D2K Center will have scientific and administrative responsibilities including:

1. integrating and visualizing disparate datatypes and organs of the renal and genitourinary tract;
2. developing, adopting, or improving state-of-the-art computational tools and approaches to carry out analyses of multi-modal molecular and imaging data;
3. building interactive 2D/3D atlases and molecular maps with FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) to promote data retrieval, exploration, discovery, and analysis by the community;
4. developing, designing, maintaining, and enhancing an open-access, interactive public data and analysis portal; and
5. coordinating internal and external activities of the GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) and (Re)Building a Kidney (RBK) consortia, including administration of an opportunity pool to address scientific gaps and opportunities.
