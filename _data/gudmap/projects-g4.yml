    The GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) has been providing valuable references for the research community studying urogenital development and diseases. It is a recurring theme that rapidly advancing new technologies are instrumental in enhancing and expanding reference databases. Cross fertilization of atlas building efforts spanning various organ systems and disease types will undoubtedly boost the technology penetration across these projects. To build multi-dimensional atlases of developing urogenital organs that incorporate the latest multi-omics and spatial molecular mapping technologies, we have assembled a team with expertise both in urogenital development and multi-dimensional, multi-platform, molecular atlas building. We propose to utilize the infrastructure we developed at our institution for the NCI Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and other large scale projects as a springboard to help effectively and efficiently propel GUDMAP to the next level with transcriptome-wide coverage, single cell level resolution, and spatial mapping with unprecedented clarity. We will take advantage of our experience in the incorporation of single nucleus (sn) RNA-seq and snATAC-seq to establish a comprehensive epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape in targeted urogenital organs and structures (lower urinary tract (LUT), selected male reproductive organs, kidney vasculature, lymphatics, and nerves) at single cell resolution (Aim 1). We will then add the spatial dimension to this molecular landscape to build 2D and 3D molecular atlases by incorporating spatial transcriptomics (ST), CODEX, and light sheet microscopy (LSM) (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will extend our study to disease models, focusing on murine models of congenital anomalies of the kidney and the urinary tract (CAKUT). With the proposed experiments, we aim at building multidimensional molecular atlases for developing urogenital organs at unprecedented cellular resolution and gene coverage with the highest efficiency possible. Aim 1: Characterize the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes of developing urogenital organs with single cell omics We will perform integrated transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling of the developing/maturing LUT, male reproductive organs, and the kidney at E16.5, NB, and 3 weeks of age. Although the focus for the kidney will be on vasculature, lymphatics, and nerves, since there is a lack of single cell omics data on most of the selected stages, our data will also help to strengthen GUDMAP data for the broadest use by the research community. Aim 2: Construct multi-dimensional molecular atlases for developing urogenital organs using spatial transcriptomics and advanced imaging technologies A major challenge for atlas building in biological systems has been spatially assigning large number of molecular features to the anatomical and cellular structures. We have successfully established experimental procedures and computational analyses pipelines for spatial transcriptomics, CODEX, and light sheet microscopic imaging, to map gene expression data, including transcriptome-wide data to cells and structures. We will use these technologies to analyze the developing/maturing lower urinary tract, male reproductive organs, and the kidney at E16.5, NB, and 3 weeks of age for the construction of truly multi-dimensional, multiplatform molecular atlases. Aim 3: Building molecular atlases for key urogenital structures using murine CAKUT models with cell ablation or gene inactivation CAKUT occurs in many different forms representing a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. We have generated and analyzed several CAKUT murine models in the past. Building atlases of the target organs for these models will provide high resolution, spatially registered molecular references for key stages of disease initiation and progression. Moreover, such atlases will help researchers better understand normal urogenital development by knowing the tolerance of the systems and processes in dealing with various disturbances. We will use a highly reproducible murine model of CAKUT with inactivation of canonical Smad signaling in ureteral mesenchyme, causing a uniform ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction phenotype prenatally. We will use the technologies outlined in Aims 1 and 2 to build molecular atlases of the relevant structures (ureter, kidney, UPJ) at key time points and compare the atlases of defective development with those of normal development.

    We will use the mouse model to investigate how differences between male and female external genitalia arise at the single cell level. Congenital malformations of the external genitalia (CAEG) are among the most prevalent human birth defects, affecting ~1:150 live male births. Hypospadias is a CAEG that is characterized by ectopic opening(s) of the urethra on the ventral side of the penis. In severe hypospadias, the urethral plate can open along the entire underside of the penis, giving it a clitoris-like appearance. This condition is termed ambiguous genitalia. Genetic causes of hypospadias have been elusive. The global prevalence has led to increased scrutiny of environmental factors, particularly endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can induce genital anomalies in animal models. Sexual differentiation of the embryonic genital tubercle (GT) into a penis or a clitoris is regulated by gonadal androgens and estrogen. The central role of sex hormones in GT development creates sensitivity to EDCs; however, the mechanisms that mediate EDC effects on the GT are unknown, particularly at a cellular level. Do EDCs that cause hypospadias act on all cells in the GT, or do they target specific cell types? If subpopulation(s) of hormonally-responsive cells control urethragenesis, then buffering those cells against EDCs could be a method for prevention of hypospadias (analogous to folic acidâ€™s ability to prevent neural tube defects). For genetic hypospadias, identifying cell-specific gene functions can distinguish direct regulators of urethragenesis from genes with indirect effects (e.g. sensitivity to EDCs). Understanding cell type diversity in developing external genitalia is essential for identifying the causes of CAEG and for developing preventative strategies. A major obstacle to progress in prevention and treatment of CAEG is the lack of knowledge of the specific cell types in external genital tissues. This project aims to fill these critical knowledge gaps by using single cell RNA-sequencing combined with novel imaging modalities to map cell type diversity in the developing external genitalia of normal male and female mice.

    This GUDMAP Atlas project is focused on the lower urinary tract (LUT; bladder and urethra) of male and female mice. The Specific Aims are to build 3D multiscale anatomical atlases of (1) the mouse LUT vasculature and (2) the autonomic and sensory innervation of this vasculature. Times of the life cycle from embryo to adult have been selected to reveal the impact of major changes in organ structure and function on vascular patterning. The outcomes of Aim 1 will fill a major gap in GUDMAP and the broader literature, where LUT vascular structures have been under-explored in comparison with LUT muscle wall and epithelium. The outcomes of Aim 2 will provide a second important dimension to GUDMAP and the literature, by superimposing on the vascular atlases the closely associated axonal plexuses (sensory and autonomic) that regulate LUT vascular function. Most of these axon classes do not originate from pelvic ganglia, so provide to the GUDMAP database new resources that are quite distinct from the existing knowledge base. In addition to developing new knowledge on the vascular system, the outcomes of the project will support generation of new hypotheses on LUT function in health and disease.

     Benign urologic diseases of the lower urinary tract such as urinary tract infections, benign prostatic hyperplasia, voiding dysfunction, urinary incontinence, interstitial cystitis, painful bladder syndrome, and urethral strictures incur significant health care burden in the US. Our lack of a comprehensive molecular and cellular understanding of these tissues in the normal and disease states has directly hindered the development of effective novel therapies for these conditions. We are proposing to generate high-resolution transcriptome and gene regulatory data set for healthy human ureter and bladder tissues across the lifespan in both sexes. The overall goal is to construct a highly integrated cellular and molecular anatomical map of the ureter and bladder in humans. This will enable us to comprehensively understand the cellular composition and lineage relationships of the lower urinary tract system. Towards this aim, we have established a robust tissue procurement and processing workflow. This allows us to recover the lower urinary track en bloc from deceased organ donors and process them, with high cell viability and tissue integrity, for molecular assays. We propose to collect scRNA-seq and Visium spatial transcriptomics data on organ donors in 3 age groups that reflect distinct physiological states in terms of lower urinary tract functions across the human life span. For each donor, we will analyze five specified anatomic locations, lower ureter, dome, ureteral orifice, bladder neck, and urethra, to comprehensively characterize parts of the lower urinary tract that have unique tissues structures and functions. We will use these data to understand the lineage relationships between the different cell types and validate novel markers for each novel cell type by immunostaining. Finally, we will perform scATAC-seq on the most informative tissue locations to gain further insight into the underlying gene regulatory networks. Together these studies will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the human bladder and ureter throughout life. These molecular data will become a valuable resource to the research community and ultimately, support efforts in organ repair and regeneration.

    Prostate organogenesis starts prior to birth, with extensive tissue growth occurring during puberty in response to androgens after the immune system is fully functional. Androgens are generally considered immune- suppressive, so this suggests contradictory roles for immune cells in the prostate, where an immune suppressive microenvironment is needed as new prostate-specific proteins are generated, yet immune cell functions are required to promote morphogenesis and tissue growth during puberty. Our recent single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of normal mouse and human prostates revealed previously unknown heterogeneity in prostate epithelial cell types. These studies form the foundation for a new direction in which I propose to shift my focus from prostate epithelial cells to investigate the function, developmental origins, and androgen-dependence of immune cells in the prostate. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate immune cell regulation of prostate organogenesis so that we can better understand the underpinnings of benign prostate disease. This application specifically seeks to elucidate the function of macrophages during prostate organogenesis and their potential contribution to BPH progression. Our central hypothesis is that heterogeneous populations of prostate macrophages with distinct cellular origins and tissue-specific properties regulate the organogenesis and function of the prostate, and their dysregulation contributes to BPH. To test our hypothesis, Specific Aim 1 will identify the function and heterogeneity of macrophages in the developing prostate. Specific Aim 2 will determine the cellular origins of macrophages in the developing prostate and in BPH. Specific Aim 3 will identify the androgen signaling requirements of macrophage populations in the developing prostate and in BPH. Under Aim 1, we will conduct immunofluorescence analysis of macrophages in prostate tissues, incorporating high-resolution 3D imaging, live imaging, and data from single-cell RNA sequencing. For Aim 2, we will conduct genetic-lineage tracing studies of macrophages of yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow origin. For Aim 3, we will test the role of AR in prostate macrophages by deleting AR in macrophages during prostate organogenesis and in a mouse model of BPH. This proposal is innovative due to the novel investigation into how immune cells contribute to promoting prostate organogenesis both prior to and during puberty in this androgen-regulated organ; the novel investigation into how AR functions in prostate immune cells to regulate organ morphogenesis and immune suppression during puberty; and the use of innovative technology. The proposed research is significant because successful completion of this proposal will elucidate the in vivo function of macrophages during prostate organogenesis; demonstrate the cellular origin of prostate macrophages across the various stages of prostate organogenesis; and clarify the in vivo role of cell-autonomous AR in macrophages during prostate organogenesis. Importantly, this project will further investigate the role of macrophages in the development of BPH, which has the potential to inform the development of improved treatment strategies for BPH.

    This project aims to generate data to visualize the developing urinary tract, to identify new functional and anatomical domains, and cell types. The embryonic hindgut or cloaca progresses from a single hollow organ to two separate entities â€“ the urinary tract and anorectal tract. The urinary tract further differentiates into the bladder rostrally and the genital urethra caudally. Guided by tissue-specific gene expression patterns, we show that several selected transcription factors and signaling molecules are critical for urinary tract development and, are responsible for some of the most complex human birth defects. However, these low-throughput and isolated case studies offer limited information; and it is difficult integrate these findings to discern gene-gene and gene-cell relationships in development and in disease. Resources including spatial annotation of all genes in all cells are needed. Using innovative technologies including single cell Multi-omics and Spatial Transcriptome, this application aims to 1) create a series of digital libraries from all cells of mouse lower urinary tract, in which every cell is annotated based on its' own transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles; 2) generate ultrahigh-density tissue- specific spatial transcriptomic map of the lower urinary tract; and 3) display spatial transcriptome at near single cell resolution onto the 3D digitalized mouse and human embryos. These resources will serve the research community to establish a comprehensive understanding of urinary tract development, including but not limited to cloaca septation and urinary tract differentiation.

    Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is nearly ubiquitous in men of advancing age and involves a dynamic interplay among the prostate, bladder and urethra. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of prostate enlargement are largely unknown. Furthermore, bladder dysfunction persists in a third of men after transurethral resection of the prostate, but the cellular basis of bladder remodeling and dysfunction are poorly understood. Contemporary single cell sequencing technologies could fundamentally revitalize our knowledge of LUTD as they have for other diseases. Unfortunately, most investigators are unable to access bladder, urethra and prostate from young and aged, disease-free males (controls) to leverage these technologies and determine how cellular behaviors change with age and disease. Moreover, the cost to deploy single cell sequencing makes a comprehensive examination of the lower urinary tract untenable for most investigators.<br/><br/>

    The proposed studies will conduct scRNA/scATAC-seq of the human prostate, urethra and bladder from young disease-free male organ donors and men of advancing age with clinically-defined BPH and detrusor overactivity. Disease-specific regulatory networks will be identified and linked to clinical phenotypes. A searchable database will be created to query processed data and request tissue specimens. The overarching goal is to eliminate barriers to primary human tissue research. For years, we have tried to test specific mechanistic hypotheses about LUTD without a thorough molecular and cellular characterization of the normal vs. diseased state. These foundational resources will generate new testable hypotheses about LUTD, lead to the creation of better animal models, and expand the diversity of investigators in LUTD research.<br/><br/>

    We will use single cell sequencing data that only we have already generated on the mouse bladder, urethra and prostate to inform our development of transgenic mice carrying cell-specific and inducible Cre recombinase in lower urinary tract stromal cell types. These new resources will enable researchers to test hypotheses arising from human LUT cell scRNA/scATAC-seq data. An innovative split-Cre approach, in which Cre recombinase fragments are driven from two independent gene promoters, will be used to ensure organ and cell specificity. Split-Cre mice will be used to trace the lineage of bladder, urethral and prostate stromal cells during clinically-relevant induction of LUTD. A genetic approach will be deployed to singly remove each cell type from the lower urinary tract to determine how it contributes to baseline urinary physiology and response to bladder outlet obstruction.  Quantitative urinary voiding phenotypes from these mice will be linked via a database to single cell sequencing data, enabling investigators to formulate cause-and-effect hypotheses. Though the resources generated here will focus on male LUTD and control tissues to establish a controlled human experimental framework, the resource is scalable and in the future can expand to include tissues and research models relevant to female benign urologic diseases and urologic cancer.
