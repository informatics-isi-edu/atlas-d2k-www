blurb: >
  (Re)Building a Kidney (RBK) is an NIDDK-funded consortium of research projects working to optimize approaches for the isolation, expansion, and differentiation of appropriate kidney cell types and their integration into complex structures that replicate human kidney function for the purpose of kidney regeneration and repair. The RBK Data Repository houses curated data and tools generated by the RBK consortium. All data and tools in the repository are searchable and accessible via web-based interfaces, REST APIs, and program libraries.
