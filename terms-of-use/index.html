---

<p>ATLAS-D2K strongly encourages the broader community to use our data in research, publications and presentations. <strong>ATLAS-D2K data is free to use with proper citations.</strong> Please follow these "Terms of Use":</p>

        <ol>
          <li><p><strong>Copyright to data and images on the ATLAS-D2K site is held by the individual contributing investigators.</strong> The Principal Investigator is listed on every data record page. Click the name in the Principal Investigator field to go to a page which will list the name and institution of the investigator.</p>
          <p><strong>Acknowledge the Investigator and Consortium that generated the data and relevant publications from investigators in any of your work resulting from the use of data in the ATLAS-D2K repository.</strong> You can find citation information by clicking on the “Share and cite” button that is available on every data record. Also acknowledge that you obtained the dataset from the ATLAS-D2K repository.</p>
          <p>Full information on citing ATLAS-D2K data and the ATLAS-D2K site is available at: <a href="/citing/">https://www.atlas-d2k.org/citing/</a>.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>We suggest that you not circulate the original data you downloaded to other potential users; instead, refer them to the ATLAS-D2K website.</strong></p>
            <p>The datasets may be periodically updated, expanded or corrected so it makes the most sense for new users to obtain the latest version directly from ATLAS-D2K. Doing so also helps us collect the usage data needed to demonstrate that the community is taking advantage of ATLAS-D2K.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Please notify ATLAS-D2K, via help[AT]atlas-d2k.org, about any of your publications resulting from analysis of ATLAS-D2K data.</strong> We will post the citations to the ATLAS-D2K website – providing more exposure for your work and another way for us to document how ATLAS-D2K is being used by the scientific community.
          </p></li>
        </ol>
