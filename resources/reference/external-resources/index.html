<h3><a href="http://imagej.net/Void_Whizzard" target="_blank">Void Whizzard</a></h3>
<p>This FIJI plugin facilitates consistently and rapidly analysis of images from the Void Spot Assay (VSA, also known as Voiding Spot on Paper, VSOP) towards the quantification of rodent voiding function, including overlapping urine spots. It packages macros for image straightening and cropping, background subtraction and thresholding, spotfinding and determination of area, volume and quantity. (Developed by the Vezina group.)</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.kidney.org/kidneyDisease/" target="_blank">National Kidney Foundation</a></h3>

<p>The National Kidney Foundation, Inc (NKF)., is the major voluntary health organization dedicated to preventing kidney disease, improving the health and well-being of individuals and families affected by kidney disease and increasing the availability of all organs for transplantation.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.kidney.org.uk/" target="_blank">UK National Kidney Federation</a></h3>
<p>The NKF is the national charity in the United Kingdom Run by Kidney Patients for Kidney Patients.</p>
<p>The Federationâ€™s aim throughout the UK is to promote both the best renal medical practice and treatment, and the health of persons suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or Established Renal Failure (ERF).</p>
<p>The NKF also supports the related needs of those relatives and friends who care for kidney patients.</p>

<p>GenePaint is a digital atlas of gene expression patterns in the mouse.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.emouseatlas.org/emage/home.php" target="_blank">EMAGE</a></h3>
<p>EMAGE is a free database of 2D and 3D gene expression patterns during mouse embryo development. All EMAGE data is housed in the common framework of the <a href="http://www.emouseatlas.org/emap/ema/home.php" target="_blank">EMAP 3D Digital Atlas</a>.</p>
<p>EMAGE aims to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a focal point for biomedical and clinical researchers to access mouse embryo in situ gene expression data sourced from the community.</li>
  <li>Offer high-quality curation and annotation of this data in the spatio-temporal and anatomical framework of the EMAP Digital Atlas.</li>
  <li>Generate and offer methods for analysis of this data.</li>
  <li>Provide EMAGE in the broader context of other bioinformatics resources to generate a tool for understanding the genetic control of mouse development.</li>
</ul>

<p>EMAGE also contains the <a href="http://www.emouseatlas.org/emap/eHistology/kaufman/index.php" target="_blank">eHistology resource</a>, developed in collaboration with Academic Press/Elsevier, which allows interactive exploration of cellular-resolution colour images detailing mouse development with annotations from the Kaufman "<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/the-atlas-of-mouse-development/kaufman/978-0-08-057131-7" target="_blank">Atlas of Mouse Development</a>".</p>
