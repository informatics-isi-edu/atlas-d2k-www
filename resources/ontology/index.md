title: GUDMAP Ontology
---

A high-resolution ontology has been developed by members of the GUDMAP consortium to describe the subcompartments of the developing murine genitourinary tract.

This ontology incorporates what can be defined histologically and begins to encompass other structures and cell types already identified at the molecular level.

The GUDMAP ontology encompasses [Theiler stage](../theiler-stages/) (TS) 17-27 of development as well as the sexually mature adult. It has been written as a partonomic, text-based, hierarchical ontology that, for the embryological stages, has been developed as a high-resolution expansion of the existing Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Project (EMAP) ontology. As of 2015, an "abstract" (i.e. non-stage-specific) representation of mouse developmental anatomy has since been developed and is referred to as **EMAPA**.

Other characteristics of this ontology:

* Includes group terms for well-characterized structural and/or functional units comprising several sub-structures, such as the nephron and juxtaglomerular complex.
* Assigns a unique identification number for each term.
* Uses synonyms to improve the success of query searching and maintain wherever possible existing EMAP terms relating to this organ system.
