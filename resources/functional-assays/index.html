<p class="acknowledgement">Provided through the <a href="/rebuildingakidney/">(Re)Building a Kidney Consortium</a>.</p>

<p>The RBK Consortium has developed the foundation for a collection of functional assays (with a current focus on <strong>physiological assays</strong>) that are both:
<ul>
  <li>critical for achieving <a href="/rebuildingakidney/about/#objectives">our consortium mission</a> - for glomerular function, tubular function and absorption, AND </li>
  <li>as transferable as possible for other labs in the consortium.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a result of work by the RBK Functional Assays Working Group, led by Dr. Lisa Satlin (Icahn School of Medicine) and includes representatives from all of the current RBK labs.</p>

<h2>Functional Assays Handbook search</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce the release of the <a href="/chaise/recordset/#2/Protocol:Functional_Assay_Handbook@sort(RID)">Functional Assays Handbook search</a>, integrated with the Data Browser, that allows you to search functional assays and filter by <em>Target Function</em>, <em>Tissue Type or Animal</em>, <em>Kidney Structure</em> and required <em>Technology</em>.</p>

<p><a href="/chaise/recordset/#2/Protocol:Functional_Assay_Handbook@sort(RID)">>> Functional Assays Handbook search</a></p>

<p>The online search is still a work in progress but contains most of the assays described in the above slide deck.</p>
