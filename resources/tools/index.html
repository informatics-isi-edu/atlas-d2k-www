    <dt><a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/bcb61471-2a44-4d00-a0af-ff085512674c" target="_blank">Atlas of healthy and injured cell states and niches in the human kidney</a></dt>
      <dd>Single-cell and single-nucleus assays were applied to a broad spectrum of healthy reference and disease kidneys. This has provided a high-resolution cellular atlas that includes rare and novel cell populations. Based on data generated by teams in the <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.org/" target="_blank">Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)</a> and <a href="https://www.kpmp.org/" target="_blank">Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)</a> consortia in collaboration with the <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/" target="_blank">Human Cell Atlas (CZI) CellxGene</a> to display the datasets.</dd>
      <dt><a href="https://app.azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/app/human-kidney" target="_blank">Azimuth :: Human Kidney Reference</a></dt>
        <dd><a href="https://hubmapconsortium.org/" target="_blank">Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)</a>'s Azimuth is a web app for reference-based single-cell analysis. Upload a counts matrix from a single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset of human kidney or load the demo dataset for testing.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://cello.shinyapps.io/kidneycellexplorer/" target="_blank">Kidney Cell Explorer</a></dt>
      <dd>A shiny app to explore an adult mouse kidney single cell dataset organized with schematics of epithelial cell structures. Includes subsets of the nephrogenic and ureteric epithelial lineages. From the <a href="https://mcmahonlab.usc.edu/">McMahon Lab (USC Stem Cell, University of Southern California)</a>.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://www.humphreyslab.com/SingleCell/" target="_blank">Kidney Interactive Transcriptomics</a></dt> <dd>Searchable web tool that allows users to query gene expression across several single cell datasets from human kidney samples. From the <a href="http://www.humphreyslab.com">Humphreys Lab (Washington University in St. Louis)</a>.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/Databases/KSBP2/" target="_blank">Kidney-Omics Databases</a></dt> <dd>Links to transcriptomic and proteomic databases for the various renal tubule epithelia compiled from published papers. From <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/epithelial-systems-biology">Mark Knepper (Epithelial Systems Biology Laboratory, NHLBI)</a>.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://atlas.kpmp.org/explorer/" target="_blank">Kidney Tissue Atlas Explorer</a></dt> <dd>Search by marker gene, cell type, or data type to view summary data visualizations across the various <a href="https://www.kpmp.org/" target="_blank">Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)</a> 'omics' technologies.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://kim.bio.upenn.edu/software/pivot.shtml" target="_blank">PIVOT</a></dt> <dd>Platform for Interactive analysis and Visualization Of Transcriptomics data, PIVOT facilitates fast and interactive RNA-Seq data analysis and visualization on a Shiny framework.
