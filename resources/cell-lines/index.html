title: Request iPSC Cell Lines

<p class="acknowledgement">Provided through the <a href="https://www.rebuildingakidney.org">(Re)Building a Kidney Consortium</a>.</p>
<p class="note">We are now able to offer the first vial of each human iPSC cell lines at no charge and the second vial of the same cell line for $250.00. The recipient will be responsible for shipping costs. This requires membership in <a href="https://pcen.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">WU-PCEN</a> (see below for details).</p>

<p>Through integrated efforts of several entities, human iPSC parental and reporter lines are available to the research community. These tools are designed to enable studies to optimize current or new protocols toward target kidney lineages, adapt differentiation efforts to additional contexts (e.g. bioprinting or scaffold seeding), or monitor the maintenance of cell identity under different culture conditions. The reporter iPSC lines are designed to mark specific kidney cell populations upon differentiation into organoids with various fluorescent proteins. Some versions include cell specific Cre recombinase expression for cell lineage tracing.  Applications also include engineering replacement kidneys and preclinical model system research.</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>The cost of obtaining Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (HiPSCs) is now covered by subsidies by the Kidney Translational Research Center (KTRC), ATLAS D2K (U24DK135157) and WU-PCEN (P50DK133943) grants. These sources should be cited in publications and presentations.</p>

<p>We will now be able to offer the first vial of each human iPSC cell lines at no charge and the second vial of the same cell line for $250.00.</p>

<p>The recipient will be automatically enrolled as a member of the <a href="https://pcen.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">WU-PCEN</a> whose mission is to generate a multimodal molecular atlas of the mouse and human kidney across the pediatric lifespan. As a member you will be able to receive PCEN grant announcements, opportunities to attend education and enrichment activities and explore collaborative opportunities, and access to cores. <em>The recipient should notify the KTRC if they do not wish to be a member of the WU-PCEN, and in such a case they will be charged $540 for the first vial of each line.</em>  The requestor will still be responsible for all shipping costs.</p>

<p>While an investigator can request as many lines as they need for their research under the free option, only 3 lines will be shipped to the same investigator in a 3-month period to ensure that the free benefit is available to other investigators in each annual cycle.</p>

<p>Each line is available through request links that initiate a process to connect you with the donating laboratory and the cell distribution center funded by ATLAS-D2K.</p>

<p>Cell lines are stored in the ATLAS-D2K iPSC repository at Washington University's <a href="https://research.wustl.edu/core-facilities/ktrc/" target="_blank">Kidney Translational Research Center (KTRC)</a>.</p>


<h3>Requesting a Cell Line</h3>

<p>The process for requesting a cell line is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Look through our available cell lines: <a href="/chaise/recordset/#2/Cell_Line:Reporter_Cell_Line?pcid=static">Browse Reporter Lines</a> | <a href="/chaise/recordset/#2/Cell_Line:Parental_Cell_Line?pcid=static">Browse Parental Lines</a></li>
  <li>For a cell line you would like to request, click the <strong><em>Request this cell line</em></strong> link on the cell line records or <strong><a href="/resources/cell-lines/request-cell-lines/">go directly to the form here</a></strong> and choose the cell line.</li>
  <li>You will receive an email with the contact information for the cell line provider.</li>
  <li>The KTRC will send you an initial email with instructions on completing and submitting all approval documentation and how to obtain the Materials Transfer Agreement (MTA) for the requested cell line.</li>
  <li>After all forms have been returned and approved, and a fully executed MTA has been emailed to the KTRC, shipping arrangements will be agreed upon and scheduled. <strong>The requester is responsible for all shipping costs.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p class="note">Please allow 4-6 weeks for the entire process of requesting, approvals, and shipping.</p>
