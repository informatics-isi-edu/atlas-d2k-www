title: McMahon Group (GUDMAP2)

<p>Genetically-modified mouse strains play an important role in unraveling tissue organization and modeling disease processes. In GUDMAP1, the McMahon group created and characterized a number of novel mouse strains to facilitate identification, isolation and genetic manipulation of key cell types within the genitourinary system. Strains are available through the <a href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/">Jackson Laboratories</a> and details of the strains and their activities can be seen at the <a href="http://www.gudmap.org/Resources/MouseStrains/Mouse_Strains_Summary.html">GUDMAP website</a>.</p>

<p>In GUDMAP2, our effort continues with an enhanced focus on the lower urinary system. Our approach utilizes the extensive resource of gene-targeted embryo stem (ES) cell lines created by the <a href="https://www.komp.org/">KOMP</a> and <a href="http://www.knockoutmouse.org/about/eucomm">EUCOMM</a> (<a href="http://www.knockoutmouse.org/">IKMC</a>)  consortia. This <a href="http://www.gudmap.org/Resources/MouseStrains/Reporter_Strategy.html">strategy</a> uses recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) to recombine at specific targeted loci a cassette encoding enhanced GFP (eGFP) and <em>cre/ERT2</em>. As a result, mouse lines generated from germ-line transmission of RMCE-modified ES cell lines, will produce these components under the regulation of the target gene-of-interest in specific cell types-of-interest. This genetic resource will facilitate and stimulate research and deepen our understanding of development and disease on the mammalian urogenital system.</p>
