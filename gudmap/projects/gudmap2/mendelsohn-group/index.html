<p>The urinary outflow tract, including the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder and upper urethra, is lined by a specialized stratified epithelium called the urothelium, composed of a basal layer, an intermediate layer and a superficial layer consisting of umbrella cells. Umbrella cells are large multinucleated cells that are specialized for synthesis and trafficking of Uroplakins, a family of secreted proteins that assemble into the crystallin plaque lining the apical surface of the urothelium that generates a leak-proof barrier between the urine and the blood. </p>
<p>The urothelium can be rendered dysfunctional by damage, or disease, including interstitial cystitis, inflammation and UTI, but at present there is no way to repair/regenerate this tissue. In addition, the urothelium is thought to be a source of stem/progenitor cells that give rise to different forms of bladder cancer. One impediment to progress has been the  paucity of markers distinguishing urothelial sub-types including progenitors. </p>
<p>As part of GUDMAP2, we will generate  a collection of genetic markers specific for urothelial sub-populations beginning with those that we have defined using transgenic and lineage-tagged mouse models  expressing RFP or GFP. In addition to umbrella cells and basal cells, we have been able to define a novel cell type that resides in the intermediate layer that is a likely umbrella cell progenitor. Flow sorted cell populations will be genetically profiled  by the Potter/Aronow labs using RNA-Seq.  Validated candidates will be assessed to determine their distribution in the mouse and human urothelium, using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.    </p>
