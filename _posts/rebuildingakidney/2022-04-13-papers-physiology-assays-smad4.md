This review of physiology assays for organoids, by [Beno Freedman](/rebuildingakidney/projects/cell-specific-novel-therapies/), also gives a shoutout to the new RBK [Functional Assays Handbook](/resources/functional-assays/) search (which is already undergoing a revamp to integrate with the Data Browser!)
