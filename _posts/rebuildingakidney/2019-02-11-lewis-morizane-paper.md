Members of RBK - Kimberly Homan and Navin Gupta from Lewis and Morizane labs, along with Joe Bonventre, Todd Valerius and others - collaborated on a study using a new approach for creating a vascularized kidney organoid that could provide more complete kidney function by using **fluidic shear stress** to promote maturity. The results were published in [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0325-y) and you can read more about the study in the Harvard Gazette:
