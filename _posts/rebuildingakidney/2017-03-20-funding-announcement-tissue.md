**Applications of 5 pages** requesting up to **$100,000 for one year** are due **June 12, 2017**.

Current areas of emphasis include:

- **Human Tissue Interrogation**
  Develop and use innovative technologies to analyze human tissue from end organs of diabetic complications. For example:

	- Develop new protocols, tools or reagents for the molecular/omic interrogation of healthy or diseased human tissue. These may involve imaging methods at the single cell level (e.g., SWITCH, systems-wide control of interaction time and kinetics of chemicals, CyTOF mass cytometry, CLARITY, etc.) or digestion of specimens into single cells for further analysis (e.g, flow cytometry, microfluidics, mass cytometry or chemical cytometry).

	- Profile and validate cell types isolated from healthy or diseased human tissue using FACS, laser-capture or other approaches. Molecular/omic profiling of cell types should inform in vitro and in vivo efforts to model, recreate or regenerate these cell types.

	- Examine the localized tissue secretory and cellular microenvironments (e.g., extracellular matrix, interstitium, wound exudate) using emerging technologies such as nanoFACS for extracellular vesicle profiling, CLASI-FISH for exploring the 3D relationships in the microbiome, or MALDI-based technologies to characterize the extracellular proteome as it relates to the development or extent of diabetic complications.

	- Bioengineer healthy or diseased end organs of diabetic complications, including incorporation of appropriate cell types, for functional testing and screening.
