The Spring 2016 issue of _Innovate Nephrology_ magazine - published by Washington University - St. Louis - will feature RBK in its cover story "Consortium Aims to Create Kidneys  in the Lab".

> For patients with end-stage kidney disease awaiting an organ transplant, the prospects can seem bleak. BECAUSE OF A SHORTAGE OF DONORS, MANY PATIENTS ON THE WAITING LIST DIE BEFORE A DONOR KIDNEY BECOMES AVAILABLE. BUT A WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY nephrology researcher is part of an international group trying to change that. Called ReBuilding a Kidney, the group is a consortium of research teams at 13 institutions working toward a common goal: creating a kidney in a lab.
