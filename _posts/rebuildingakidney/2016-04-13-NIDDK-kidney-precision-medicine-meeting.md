The NIDDK Kidney Precision Medicine Meeting which will be held at the Double Tree Hotel, Bethesda, MD from May 23rd to May 25th, 2016. Here's the link to the meeting website <http://www.niddk.nih.gov/news/events-calendar/Pages/kidneyprecision2016.aspx>. The long-term goal of the project is to obtain and evaluate human kidney biopsies to delineate subgroup diagnoses and identify cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies in AKI and CKD.

**Background:** Despite many academic and industry efforts to treat acute and chronic kidney disease, therapies remain limited.  This conference aims to bring together basic, clinical, and translational scientists, health care professionals from industry and government, and patients with an interest in the treatment of acute and chronic kidney disease:

- To recognize the heterogeneity of AKI and CKD and the importance in differentiating such heterogeneity so that precise treatments can be developed and provided to individual patients.
- To determine the quantity and usability of currently available kidney tissues obtained from patients with AKI and CKD.
- To discuss the need, challenges, and barriers in obtaining research biopsies from patients with acute and chronic kidney disease, as well as the negative consequence of not obtaining kidney tissues in the current and future treatment of those patients.
- To establish the scientific and clinical quality control/assurance metrics and training needed for setting up a network to obtain kidney research biopsies.
- To showcase recent advances in using multi-scale interrogation of tissue and cells to understanding heterogeneity within tissue and disease.    
- To discuss the phasing and priority needed to move the field forward.

This initiative is being designed using lessons learned from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) project, and we hope to engage participation of pharmaceutical and biotech companies.
