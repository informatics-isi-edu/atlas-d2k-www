#### Project Submission Cycle XI

KHI will hold its next project submission, Cycle XI, in Spring 2019 to correspond with the Seventh Annual KHI Stakeholders Meeting scheduled for May 29-30, 2019. This will allow for more time to complete current activities and develop project ideas. Opening and closing dates will be announced later.

If you have a project idea and were considering a Fall/ Winter submission or would like to discuss the concept for the Spring Cycle XI, please contact Rick Kempinski at [rkempinski@asn-online.org](mailto:rkempinski@asn-online.org).
