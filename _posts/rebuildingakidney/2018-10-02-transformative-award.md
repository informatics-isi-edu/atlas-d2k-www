Andy McMahon is one of the co-PIs of a project awarded an NIH Director's [Transformative Research Award](https://commonfund.nih.gov/tra) for [MAPPING PROTEIN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ORGANS IN HOMEOSTASIS AND DISEASE](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?icde=0&aid=9565085) along with Steve Carr (PI) Norbert Perrimon, and Alice Ting (co-PIs). The award supports individuals or teams proposing transformative projects that are inherently risky and untested but have the potential to create or overturn fundamental paradigms.
