The [Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL)](https://ncats.nih.gov/stemcell) at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of NIH Common Fund’s Regenerative Medicine Program (RMP), is seeking new collaborators to help address scientific and technological challenges in the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) field. Working with the SCTL is an opportunity to develop efficient and standardized methods to produce specific mature cell types from iPSCs.

Interested investigators may submit proposals to collaborate with the SCTL on projects to bring iPSC technology closer to clinical application, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine. Proposals are accepted quarterly. **The next deadline for proposals is November 1st**. All data and resources produced through SCTL collaborative projects are made accessible through joint scientific publications and the SCTL website. The NIH intramural and extramural communities, as well as those from the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, are encouraged to submit proposals to collaborate with the SCTL. 

We encourage you to share with colleagues you think may be interested in this opportunity.

Learn how to submit a proposal to collaborate with the SCTL at [https://ncats.nih.gov/stemcell/work/proposal](https://ncats.nih.gov/stemcell/work/proposal) and take a virtual tour of the SCTL at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAx6g5zcfXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAx6g5zcfXg).
