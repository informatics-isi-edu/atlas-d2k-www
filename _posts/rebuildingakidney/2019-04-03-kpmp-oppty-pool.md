Recent advances in multi-scale interrogation of human tissue and single cells have set the stage for precision medicine to be applied to kidney disease. [The objectives of the Kidney Precision Medicine Project](https://kpmp.org/for-researchers/) are to ethically and safely obtain and evaluate human kidney biopsies from participants with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) or Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), create a kidney tissue atlas, define disease subgroups, and identify critical cells, pathways and targets for novel therapies. [Learn more about the KPMP protocols and processes](https://kpmp.org/for-researchers/for-researchers/resources/).
 
The KPMP recognizes that it must collaborate with the broader research community to fully achieve these objectives.  Thus, the KPMP Central Hub administers an “Opportunity Pool” to facilitate the formation of new partnerships.
 
**CURRENT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES:**

- **Obtain healthy reference tissue to help build the KPMP kidney tissue atlas. [Read more...](https://kpmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/KPMP-OP-RFA_Healthy_ReferenceTissue_2019-03-22.pdf)**
- **Develop kidney biomimetic “phantoms” as quality control standards. [Read more...](https://kpmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/KPMP-OP-RFA_Phantom_Tissue_2019-03-26.pdf)**
