*Summary:*

 In polycystic kidney disease (PKD), microscopic tubules expand into macroscopic cysts. Among the world's most common genetic disorders, PKD is inherited via heterozygous loss-of-function mutations but is theorized to require additional loss of function. To test this, we establish human pluripotent stem cells in allelic series representing four common nonsense mutations, using CRISPR base editing. When differentiated into kidney organoids, homozygous mutants spontaneously form cysts, whereas heterozygous mutants (original or base corrected) express no phenotype. Using these, we identify eukaryotic ribosomal selective glycosides (ERSGs) as PKD therapeutics enabling ribosomal readthrough of these same nonsense mutations. Two different ERSGs not only prevent cyst initiation but also limit growth of pre-formed cysts by partially restoring polycystin expression. Furthermore, glycosides accumulate in cyst epithelia in organoids and mice. Our findings define the human polycystin threshold as a surmountable drug target for pharmacological or gene therapy interventions, with relevance for understanding disease mechanisms and future clinical trials.
