title: "Requesting Reporter and Parental Cell Lines"

RBK has released several reporter and parental cell lines and we have now formalized the request process.

These tools are designed to enable studies to optimize current or new protocols toward target kidney lineages, adapt differentiation efforts to additional contexts (e.g. bioprinting or scaffold seeding), or monitor the maintenance of cell identity under different culture conditions. The reporter iPSC lines are designed to mark specific kidney cell populations upon differentiation into organoids with various fluorescent proteins. Some versions include cell-specific _Cre_ recombinase expression for cell lineage tracing.

_Please allow 4-6 weeks for requesting, granting necessary approvals for and shipping your cell line._
