Dr. Andy McMahon, director of the Stem Cell Institute, USC, and his lab [published three papers in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (JASN)](http://jasn.asnjournals.org/gca?allch=&submit=Go&gca=jnephrol;ASN.2017080887v1&gca=jnephrol;ASN.2017091036v1&gca=jnephrol;ASN.2017080890v1) today that detail several similarities and differences in how the kidney develops in mice and humans - at the molecular, cellular and genetic levels. This massive amount of data will be crucial in helping researchers with the ultimate goal of building kidneys from human cells while working from mouse blueprints and adds a human component for kidney research that has never before been available.

_At an early stage, a nephron forming in the human kidney generates an S-shaped structure. Green cells will generate the kidneys’ filtering device, and blue and red cells specialized regions responsible for distinct nephron activities.

You can find all referenced images and data organized into "collections" (much like a virtual "album")   [here](/chaise/recordset/#2/Common:Collection/*::facets::N4IghgdgJiBcDaoDOB7ArgJwMYFM4gBUBLAFwBs8AaELACxSNyTnhAGEUIkcMA3HKAAJIQgCJF+GAOY4IJQQDEcYEphxJBKAGaCAEmgC2kYdEEBZdN0EBpIlAg4AnoIDy0yChkOkRZtQ5cPPxCIoLikl7ySipqGtrm6rJ0jkZkggAKGJ6ypCgYgmw4ZGkEjgAO6oIA7qS0RBCCJLQ4BXkkjGBpAHI4ZbRZXoyCXYzNmjpNLfpGDaEWaFa29k4g-pzcfAImYhI8keYoFFhoZGD5oQCCECooBkPRqhiV8dPGc5YtPX1ZDekqJDwIPUpCAALoAXwhQA@sort(RID)?pcid=static).

These collections were made using the underlying DERIVA software that is powering the new GUDMAP data browser (which launches officially in April). [Read more about collections here.](http://isrd.isi.edu/2018/02/15/collections-and-papers/)
