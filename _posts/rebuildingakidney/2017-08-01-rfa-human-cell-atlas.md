The Human Cell Atlas is a global effort to create a reference atlas of all cells in the healthy human body as a resource for studies of health and disease. 

This endeavor will generate molecular and imaging data across a range of modalities and spatial scales, requiring new probabilistic and integrative approaches for analysis and interpretation, systematic comparison of methods on benchmark datasets, and mechanisms for disseminating these methods to a wide community. 

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative seeks applications for the development of computational tools, algorithms, visualizations, and benchmark datasets in support of this endeavor. **[Full details here](http://chanzuckerberg.com/initiatives/rfa)**.

**Applications due August 28, 2017 by 5:00 PM PT**
