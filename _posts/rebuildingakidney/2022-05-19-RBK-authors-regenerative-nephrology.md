Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major clinical and economic problem worldwide and currently there are no effective treatments. Due to the numerous renal insults that lead to AKI and the complexity of injury, many pathways are dysregulated leading to maladaptive repair, which can lead to chronic kidney disease. The focus of this chapter is to illustrate the pathways that play a role in AKI and how small molecules for therapeutic intervention can be utilized to modulate their activity and enhance productive repair. Given the large number of pathways that could be therapeutic targets, we will focus on only a limited number that have shown promising results in the treatment of AKI.

Senescent cells, characterized typically by irreversible cell cycle arrest coupled with marked transcriptional changes and a pro-inflammatory secretome, are proposed as key drivers of kidney fibrosis with the epithelial cells of the renal tubule playing a central role. In this chapter, we discuss the accumulating evidence that senescence is associated with aging and a number of renal diseases in humans and that this is associated with worsened kidney function and outcome. We also review the insights gained from studies using a variety of animal models and discuss how these have informed our knowledge of the processes underlying cellular senescence and fibrosis in the kidney.
