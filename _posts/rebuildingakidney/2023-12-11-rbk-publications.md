We are thrilled to bring you the latest updates from our community of researchers who are making significant strides in kidney regeneration and related fields. This newsletter highlights three recent publications that each represent a leap forward in our understanding and capabilities in kidney research.

### **In Vivo Assessment of Laboratory-Grown Kidney Tissue Grafts**

*Authors:* Chuang, Tinghsien; Bejar, Justin; Yue, Zhiwei; Slavinsky, Mary; Marciano, Denise; Drummond, Iain and Oxburgh, Leif

*Journal:* Bioengineering (Basel). Vol. 10(11), 1261. October 2023.

*URL:* [https://www.doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10111261](https://www.doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10111261)

Summary: We show that one significant obstacle to tubule fusion is the accumulation of fibrillar collagens at the interface between the graft and the host. As a screening strategy to identify factors that can prevent this collagen accumulation, we propose encapsulating laboratory-grown kidney tissue in fibrin hydrogels supplemented with candidate compounds such as recombinant proteins, small molecules, feeder cells, and gene therapy vectors to condition the local graft environment. We demonstrate that the AAV-DJ serotype is an efficient gene therapy vector for the subcapsular region and that it is specific for interstitial cells in this compartment. In addition to the histological evaluation of epithelial tubule fusion, we demonstrate the specificity of two urine biomarker assays that can be used to detect human-specific markers of the proximal nephron (CD59) and the distal nephron (uromodulin), and we demonstrate the deposition of human graft-derived urine into the mouse collecting system. Using the testing platform described in this report, it will be possible to systematically screen factors for their potential to promote epithelial fusion of graft and host tissue with a functional intravital read-out.

### **Navigating the kidney organoid: insights into assessment and enhancement of nephron function**

*Authors:* Tabibzadeh, Nahid; Satlin, Lisa M.; Jain, Sanjay and Morizane, Ryuji

*Journal:* American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology. Vol. 325(6), F695â€“F706. December 2023.

*URL:* [https://doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00166.2023](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00166.2023)

Summary: Kidney organoids are three-dimensional structures derived from stem cells, mimicking the major components of mammalian kidneys. Although they show great promise, their functional capacity has become a critical question. This review explores the advancements and challenges in evaluating and enhancing kidney organoid function, including the use of organ-on-chip technologies, multiomics data, and in vivo transplantation. Integrating these approaches to further enhance their physiological relevance will continue to advance disease modeling and regenerative medicine applications.

### **Uniform quantification of single-nucleus ATAC-seq data with Paired-Insertion Counting (PIC) and a model-based insertion rate estimator**

*Authors:* Miao, Zhen and Kim, Junhyong

*Journal:* Nature Methods. December 2023.

*URL:* [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-02103-7](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-02103-7)

Summary: Existing approaches to scoring single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) feature matrices from sequencing reads are inconsistent, affecting downstream analyses and displaying artifacts. We show that, even with sparse single-cell data, quantitative counts are informative for estimating the regulatory state of a cell, which calls for a consistent treatment. We propose Paired-Insertion Counting as a uniform method for snATAC-seq feature characterization and provide a probability model for inferring latent insertion dynamics from snATAC-seq count matrices.
