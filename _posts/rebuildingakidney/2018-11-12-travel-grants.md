This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) requests applications for the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) Opportunity Pool Travel Grant. **All applications are due by 5:00 PM EST on Monday November 19th, 2018** to kpmp@uw.edu.

The objectives of the KPMP are to ethically obtain and evaluate human kidney biopsies from participants with AKI or CKD, create a kidney tissue atlas, define disease subgroups, and identify critical cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies.

The consortium would like to encourage wide participation in the KPMP face-to-face meetings held throughout the year. To this end, eligible investigators for this opportunity announcement would be any early career investigators who are engaged in basic, clinical, or translational research relevant to the goals of the KPMP and are not currently KPMP key personnel. For the purposes of this announcement, early-career investigators include graduate or medical students, post-doctoral fellows, clinical residents and fellows, and junior faculty. Early-career investigators attending the meeting will learn about KPMP protocols in development, scientific technologies to be applied to the interrogation of kidney biopsy tissue, the role of patient engagement in KPMP, and how data management and visualization tools will be applied to the creation of a kidney atlas. It is expected that this opportunity will lead to increased collaborations for the KPMP consortium. All eligible applicants, including past awardees are encouraged to apply. Lower priority will be given to applicants who have received KPMP travel support in the past year.

The KPMP consortium is hosting its next face to face meeting on January 8th and 9th, 2019 in the Washington D.C. area. Junior investigators conducting research of interest to KPMP and who are interested in attending may apply for a travel grant for up to $1,200 (based on space availability and scoring). Selected awardees must give a poster presentation on their submitted research at the meeting on January 8th, 2019. Up to 12 awardees will be selected to attend the meeting.
