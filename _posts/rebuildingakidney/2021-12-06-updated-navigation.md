The RBK Hub has updated the site to unify the navigation bar across all parts of [www.rebuildingakidney.org](https://www.rebuildingakidney.org). The navigation bar structure is designed for ease of access to different types of data and information. It is also aligned well with the [GUDMAP](https://www.gudmap.org) navigation bar.

The following are the top-level menu items and what you can expect to find:

* **BROWSE DATA** - Entry point to the data repo which highlights various options: SEARCH BY (by gene, by investigator, etc), MODALITY/MODES (imaging, transcriptomics, etc), VISUALIZATIONS options for mRNA-Seq and scRNA-Seq and LAB RESOURCES AND TOOLS (protocols, cell lines, antibodies, etc).
* **USING RBK** - Links to documentation about using RBK.
* **RESOURCES** - Request iPSC cell lines, learn about tools available in the community, get links to useful reference material from GUDMAP relevant to kidney researchers, etc.
* **CONSORTIUM** - This section includes information specifically regarding the RBK Consortium as well as listings of RBK publications and RBK projects.
* **DASHBOARDS** - Links here will take you to graphs and tables that summarize the available data and data submissions.
* **INTERNAL** - *For members of the RBK consortium*, this section includes direct links for creating data records, links to internal collaboration websites and links to documentation for submitting data.
* **"Go to RID" search bar** - Although this isn't technically part of the navigation, it is a useful feature on the right side of the top menu bar that lets you enter an "RID" to go directly to a data record. **RID** stands for "Record ID", the unique permanent identifier for all RBK data.

We hope this will help make the ReBuilding a Kidney website more useful for you. If you have feedback, please let us know [via the Contact page](/contact/)!
