**Summary:** 

Recent advances in stem cell research have led to the creation of organoids, miniature replicas of human organs, offering innovative avenues for studying diseases. Kidney organoids, with their ability to replicate complex renal structures, provide a novel platform for investigating kidney diseases and assessing drug efficacy, albeit hindered by labor-intensive generation and batch variations, highlighting the need for tailored cryopreservation methods to enable widespread utilization. Here, we evaluated cryopreservation strategies for kidney organoids by contrasting slow-freezing and vitrification methods. 118 kidney organoids were categorized into five conditions. Control organoids followed standard culture, while two slow-freezing groups used 10% DMSO (SF1) or commercial freezing media (SF2). Vitrification involved V1 (20% DMSO, 20% Ethylene Glycol with sucrose) and V2 (15% DMSO, 15% Ethylene Glycol). Assessment of viability, functionality, and structural integrity post-thawing revealed notable differences. Vitrification, particularly V1, exhibited superior viability (91% for V1, 26% for V2, 79% for SF1, and 83% for SF2 compared to 99.4% in controls). 3D imaging highlighted distinct nephron segments among groups, emphasizing V1’s efficacy in preserving both podocytes and tubules in kidney organoids. Cisplatin-induced injury revealed a significant reduction in regenerative capacities in organoids cryopreserved by flow-freezing methods, while the V1 method did not show statistical significance compared to the unfrozen controls. This study underscores vitrification, especially with high concentrations of cryoprotectants, as an effective approach for maintaining kidney organoid viability and structure during cryopreservation, offering practical approaches for kidney organoid research.

### Advancing preclinical drug evaluation through automated 3D imaging for high-throughput screening with kidney organoids

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1088/1758-5090/ad38df](https://doi.org/10.1088/1758-5090/ad38df) 

**Summary:** 

High-throughput drug screening is crucial for advancing healthcare through drug discovery. However, a significant limitation arises from available *in vitro* models using conventional 2D cell culture, which lack the proper phenotypes and architectures observed in three-dimensional (3D) tissues. Recent advancements in stem cell biology have facilitated the generation of organoids—3D tissue constructs that mimic human organs *in vitro*. Kidney organoids, derived from human pluripotent stem cells, represent a significant breakthrough in disease representation. They encompass major kidney cell types organized within distinct nephron segments, surrounded by stroma and endothelial cells. This tissue allows for the assessment of structural alterations such as nephron loss, a characteristic of chronic kidney disease. Despite these advantages, the complexity of 3D structures has hindered the use of organoids for large-scale drug screening, and the drug screening pipelines utilizing these complex *in vitro* models remain to be established for high-throughput screening. In this study, we address the technical limitations of kidney organoids through fully automated 3D imaging, aided by a machine-learning approach for automatic profiling of nephron segment-specific epithelial morphometry. Kidney organoids were exposed to the nephrotoxic agent cisplatin to model severe acute kidney injury. An U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library was tested for therapeutic and nephrotoxicity screening. The fully automated pipeline of 3D image acquisition and analysis identified nephrotoxic or therapeutic drugs during cisplatin chemotherapy. The nephrotoxic potential of these drugs aligned with previous in vivo and human reports. Additionally, Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in hematological malignancies, was identified as a potential preventive therapy for cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Our proof-of-concept report demonstrates that the automated screening process, using 3D morphometric assays with kidney organoids, enables high-throughput screening for nephrotoxicity and therapeutic assessment in 3D tissue constructs.

### Advancements in therapeutic development: kidney organoids and organs on a chip

**Journal:** Kidney International<br/>
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2023.11.035](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2023.11.035) 

**Summary:** 

The use of animal models in therapeutic development has long been the standard practice. However, ethical concerns and the inherent species differences have prompted a reevaluation of the experimental approach in human disease studies. The urgent need for alternative model systems that better mimic human pathophysiology has led to the emergence of organoids, innovative *in vitro* models, to simulate human organs *in vitro*. These organoids have gained widespread acceptance in disease models and drug development research. In this mini review, we explore the recent strides made in kidney organoid differentiation and highlight the synergistic potential of incorporating organ-on-chip systems. The emergent use of microfluidic devices reveals the importance of fluid flow in the maturation of kidney organoids and helps decipher pathomechanisms in kidney diseases. Recent research has uncovered their potential applications across a wide spectrum of kidney research areas, including hemodynamic forces at stake in kidney health and disease, immune cell infiltration, or drug delivery and toxicity. This convergence of cutting-edge technologies not only holds promise for expediting therapeutic development but also reflects an acknowledgment of the need to embrace innovative and more human-centric research models.
