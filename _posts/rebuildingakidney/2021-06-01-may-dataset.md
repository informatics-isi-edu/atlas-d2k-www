**2 Sequencing Studies:**

* [Translational profiles of proximal tubule during kidney fibrosis](https://www.rebuildingakidney.org/id/16-2CNW). Injury to the proximal tubule plays a central role in the initiation and progression of kidney fibrosis, and rates of chronic kidney disease progresses approximately 50% faster in males compared to females. We applied Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) followed by RNA-sequencing to characterize the cell-specific proximal tubule transcriptional landscape during fibrosis in male vs. female mice.

* [RNA-Seq profiling of day 7 and day 18 kidney organoids differentiated in two batches](https://www.rebuildingakidney.org/id/Q-Y4H6). The kidney differentiation protocol takes induced pluripotent stem cells through to kidney organoid via directed differentiation in approximately 25 days. The cells are grown in a monolayer in a dish for seven days and are subjected to growth factors before being pelleted on day seven. The organoids then continue to differentiate as a 3D structure, with at least 8 distinct kidney cell types identifiable around day 18. This data has been generated to investigate the reproducibility of the kidney differentiation protocol using RNA sequencing from day 18 organoids. Organoid differentiations were performed in two separate batches separated in time. The resulting RNA-seq data was analysed to identify genes with highly variable expression between batches.
