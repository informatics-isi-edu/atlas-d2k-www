Here are two new publications from the RBK consortium:

"Spatial Transcriptomics Defines Injury-Specific Microenvironments in the Adult Mouse Kidney and Novel Cellular Interactions in Regeneration and Disease (preprint)," spearheaded by Michal Polonsky and team from Andy McMahon's lab (USC), utilizes cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics to unravel the complex cellular interplay and gene expression patterns in kidney injury and repair.

"3D Hydrogel Encapsulation Regulates Nephrogenesis in Kidney Organoids," led by Bryan Nerger and colleagues from Joe Bonventre's lab (BWH), delves into the impact of mechanical signals on nephrogenesis, revealing how hydrogel encapsulation influences kidney organoid development.

These studies not only enhance our understanding of kidney function and disease but also pave the way for innovative approaches in kidney regenerative medicine.

*Summary:* Kidney injury disrupts the intricate renal architecture and triggers limited regeneration, and injury-invoked inflammation and fibrosis. Deciphering molecular pathways and cellular interactions driving these processes is challenging due to the complex renal architecture. Here, we applied single cell spatial transcriptomics to examine ischemia-reperfusion injury in the mouse kidney. Spatial transcriptomics revealed injury-specific and spatially-dependent gene expression patterns in distinct cellular microenvironments within the kidney and predicted Clcf1-Crfl1 in a molecular interplay between persistently injured proximal tubule cells and neighboring fibroblasts. Immune cell types play a critical role in organ repair. Spatial analysis revealed cellular microenvironments resembling early tertiary lymphoid structures and identified associated molecular pathways. Collectively, this study supports a focus on molecular interactions in cellular microenvironments to enhance understanding of injury, repair and disease.

*Summary:* Stem cell‐derived kidney organoids contain nephron segments that recapitulate morphological and functional aspects of the human kidney. However, directed differentiation protocols for kidney organoids are largely conducted using biochemical signals to control differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signals regulate nephrogenesis is investigated in 3D culture by encapsulating kidney organoids within viscoelastic alginate hydrogels with varying rates of stress relaxation. Tubular nephron segments are significantly more convoluted in kidney organoids differentiated in encapsulating hydrogels when compared with those in suspension culture. Hydrogel viscoelasticity regulates the spatial distribution of nephron segments within the differentiating kidney organoids. Consistent with these observations, a particle‐based computational model predicts that the extent of deformation of the hydrogel–organoid interface regulates the morphology of nephron segments. Elevated extracellular calcium levels in the culture medium, which can be impacted by the hydrogels, decrease the glomerulus‐to‐tubule ratio of nephron segments. These findings reveal that hydrogel encapsulation regulates nephron patterning and morphology and suggest that the mechanical microenvironment is an important design variable for kidney regenerative medicine.
