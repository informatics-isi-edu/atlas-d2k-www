We are proud to present a new publication from the ReBuilding a Kidney (RBK) consortium, led by Benjamin S. Freedman (University of Washington), that offers crucial insights into the role of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in kidney disease.

**Summary:** 

Elevated interferon (IFN) signaling is associated with kidney diseases including COVID-19, HIV, and apolipoprotein-L1 (APOL1) nephropathy, but whether IFNs directly contribute to nephrotoxicity remains unclear. Using human kidney organoids, primary endothelial cells, and patient samples, we demonstrate that IFN-γ induces pyroptotic angiopathy in combination with APOL1 expression. Single-cell RNA sequencing, immunoblotting, and quantitative fluorescence-based assays reveal that IFN-γ-mediated expression of APOL1 is accompanied by pyroptotic endothelial network degradation in organoids. Pharmacological blockade of IFN-γ signaling inhibits APOL1 expression, prevents upregulation of pyroptosis-associated genes, and rescues vascular networks. Multiomic analyses in patients with COVID-19, proteinuric kidney disease, and collapsing glomerulopathy similarly demonstrate increased IFN signaling and pyroptosis-associated gene expression correlating with accelerated renal disease progression. Our results reveal that IFN-γ signaling simultaneously induces endothelial injury and primes renal cells for pyroptosis, suggesting a combinatorial mechanism for APOL1-mediated collapsing glomerulopathy, which can be targeted therapeutically.
