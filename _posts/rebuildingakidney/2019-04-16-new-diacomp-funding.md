**The 2019 DiaComp Pilot & Feasibility Program**

The NIDDK-sponsored [Diabetic Complications Consortium](https://www.diacomp.org/) (**DiaComp**) is soliciting applications for its annual [**Pilot and Feasibility Program**](https://www.diacomp.org/shared/pilotFeasibility.aspx)

**PLEASE NOTE:  DiaComp can NOT accept applications from outside the United States and applications are limited to diabetic complications research that fall within the primary mission of the NIDDK. This includes diabetic nephropathy, uropathy, neuropathy, neurocognition, gastrointestinal, liver, bone, and wound healing.**

**Applications of 5 pages** requesting up to **$100,000** **for one year** are due **June 10, 2019.**

**Current areas of interest include, but are not limited to:**

* **Imaging** There is a critical need to develop innovative technologies to image human tissue from end organs of diabetic complications to better understand (patho)physiology and (dys)function.
 

* **Spatial Integration and Visualization of Single Cell Data** Many investigators dissociate tissues to assess single cells at the molecular/-omic level (e.g., genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic). There is a critical need to develop better computational tools, that may include machine learning, to analyze these data sets and provide spatial context to single cell/nucleus data.
 

* **Sex Differences** Diabetic complications manifest themselves differently between men and women. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of these manifestations is critical to designing tailored therapeutic approaches.
 

* **Autonomic Neuropathy** Diabetic complications can result from several factors including direct effects of hyperglycemia, underlying microvascular or autonomic nerve dysfunction, or mixed effects from multiple contributing factors. Additional studies are needed to better understand the relative contribution of autonomic innervation on the diabetic dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and urologic organs (bladder, prostate, erectile tissue).
 

* **Pre-clinical Testing** There is a compelling need to translate novel, scientifically meritorious therapeutic interventions for diabetic complications.

**Who is eligible to apply?**

Applications are accepted from domestic (US) institutions/organizations.

Non‐domestic (non‐U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions) are **NOT** eligible to apply.

**What funds are available for P&F Projects?**

Applicants may request up to $100,000 (direct + indirect costs) Total Costs for one year. The number of awards will depend upon the number, quality, duration, and cost of the applications received.  Awards will be made as subcontracts from the DiaComp Coordinating Unit (CU) at **Augusta University** and **NOT** directly by the NIH.

**Timetable for P&F Application Submissions.**

**June 10th**    Deadline for applications submitted to the DiaComp CU.

**Oct. 1st**     Estimated Start Date for DiaComp P&F Project funding.

**The 2019 DiaComp Conference Support Program**


The NIDDK-sponsored [Diabetic Complications Consortium](https://www.diacomp.org/) (**DiaComp**) is soliciting applications for the [Conference Support Program](https://www.diacomp.org/shared/conferenceSupport.aspx)

**Applications of 5 pages** requesting up to **$20,000 per conference** are due **June 10, 2019** for conferences with **start dates after September 1, 2019**.

A scientific conference is defined as a symposium, seminar, workshop, or formal conference where individuals assemble to exchange scientific information.

This program supports high-quality scientific conferences that feature sessions or speakers directly relevant to diabetic complications and that promote communication and collaboration between research communities investigating similar pathologic mechanisms in different end organs of complications. Strong proposals will also inform investigative communities that have not traditionally been involved in complications research.

**A few examples of meritorious proposals might include, but are not limited to:**

* The organizers are planning a multi-day conference focused on diabetes and propose to add a keynote presentation and several other individual speakers to highlight complications throughout the agenda. They also propose a dedicated poster session and travel awards for junior investigators involved in complications research.
 

* The organizers are planning a two-day conference on basic mitochondrial biology and propose to add a session on the role of mitochondrial (dys)function in diabetic complications. They request support for 3 senior investigators and 2 junior investigators to present their scientific findings and a session chair to lead a panel discussion about research opportunities in complications.
 

* The organizers are planning a day and half long conference on novel imaging modalities as applied to renal disease and propose a dedicated session on the diabetic kidney. They request support for 3 additional speakers and the travel of junior investigators to present oral or poster abstracts.

**Who is eligible to apply?**

Domestic institutions or organizations, including established scientific or professional societies, are eligible to apply for conference support. Foreign institutions are NOT eligible to apply for conference support. Both domestic and international conferences may be supported; however, an international conference can be supported only through the U.S. representative organization of an established international scientific or professional society. Requests for conferences held outside of North America are generally not allowed. An individual is not eligible to receive a grant in support of a conference.

**What funds are available for Conference Support Projects?**

Applicants may request up to $20,000 per conference per year. Multi-year applications are NOT allowed. The number of awards will depend upon the number, quality, and cost of the applications received. Facilities and Administrative (F&A) costs are NOT allowed.  Awards will be made as subcontracts from the DiaComp Coordinating Unit (CU) at **Augusta University** and **NOT** directly by the NIH.

**Timetable for Conference Support Application Submissions.**

**June 10th**    Deadline for applications submitted to the DiaComp CU.

**Sept. 1st**    Minimum conference start dates
