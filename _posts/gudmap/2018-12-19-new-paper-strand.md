This month, the Strand lab published [A cellular anatomy of the normal adult human prostate and prostatic urethra](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31877-1) in _Cell Reports_. Highlights include creation of a cellular anatomy of the young human prostate by scRNA sequencing, verified purification scheme for every cell type by flow cytometry. Localization of every cell type in whole-mount transverse sections, and discovery of Club and Hillock epithelia enriched in the urethra and proximal ducts.
