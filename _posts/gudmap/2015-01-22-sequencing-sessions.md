GUDMAP has recently had 6 Next-Gen Sequencing Series added to its database. Data comes from Steve Potter (including kidney single cell data), Cathy Mendelsohn (developing lower urinary region), Sanjay Jain (dorsal root ganglion). These are accessible here: [GUDMAP Sequencing Series](http://www.gudmap.org/gudmap/pages/ngd_series_browse.html).
