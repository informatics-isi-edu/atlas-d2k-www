We have recently added some new features to [gudmap.org](http://gudmap.org/): enhanced TIFF display, re-ordered homepage links and easier copying of cite-friendly links for data records.

Please give us your feedback on these new features by sending email to [help@gudmap.org](mailto:help@gudmap.org) or [filling out the Feedback form](https://isrd.wufoo.com/forms/s11zsu750g4r50y/).

### Enhanced TIFF display

We now have the ability to not only view TIFF imaging data in the web browser but also to allow users to zoom in/out (for high-resolution data) and pan around to view finer details.

TIFF images are now converted to a tiled, multi-resolution format that allows you to interact with high-resolution images at multiple resolutions.

Features include:

* For high-resolution data, you can use the "Zoom In" button and then your mouse (click and drag) to pan around the image.

* Our web app also supports taking a snapshot of the displayed image (click the "Take a Screenshot" button).

* To view the image in its own window, just click the "(full screen)" link that appears right above the viewer frame.

Here is a link to an example of a high-resolution image of an adult human prostate wholemount from Doug Strandâ€™s lab:  [https://www.gudmap.org/id/16-201C](https://www.gudmap.org/id/16-201C).

### Other new features on [gudmap.org](http://gudmap.org/)

* **Share your data more easily:** Under the *Share* menu on individual record pages, you can click on the Copy icon next to the cite-friendly *Versioned* and *Live* links to copy the URL to your clipboard.  

* **Improved order of homepage links:** Based on feedback, we have re-ordered the links under the "Data" column on the homepage to take into account our strongest data offerings (in particular, highlighting in-situ hybridization and other imaging data).
