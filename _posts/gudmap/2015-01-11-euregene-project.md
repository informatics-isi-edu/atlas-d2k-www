The EuReGene Project website has now been moved so that it is housed within GUDMAP. This is to ensure it's continued existence and availavility. The new URL to access EuReGene is [www.gudmap.org/euregene](http://www.gudmap.org/euregene). (UPDATE: The funding for this project has now closed.)

The existing Xenopus data (XGEbase) is being ported to the XenBase project ([http://www.xenbase.org](http://www.xenbase.org)). This will become the primary route for accessing this data (although it will remain available in an unsupported format through EuReGene).

All EuReGene (mouse) data is now fully incorporated into the GUDMAP database - available through it's browse and search tools.  
IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT EUREGENE ANNOTATIONS: Annotations within EuReGene entries are currently under review by the GUDMAP editorial office and Kylie Georgas (Little Lab, University of Queensland). In due course the annotations will be changed to reflect this review process. Original EuReGene annotations will continue to be available from [www.gudmap.org/euregene](http://www.gudmap.org/euregene)
