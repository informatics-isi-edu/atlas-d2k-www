The GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) was established fifteen years ago to create a detailed molecular map of genitourinary tract development. In recognition of this milestone, this symposium will review GUDMAP accomplishments and discuss the future directions of the GUDMAP Consortium and its data resources.

We invite academic researchers and scientists in the biomedical community to join our celebration (via Zoom). This event features invited talks from external speakers; presentations from GUDMAP investigators showcasing their biomedical research and progress; relevant data, resources, breakout groups or discussions around key topics (e.g., bioinformatics, data quality), and tools available in the GUDMAP Hub for the broader communities at large; posters or lightning talks presentations from young investigators; and more.
