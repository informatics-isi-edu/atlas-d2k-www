We are happy to release the new website for the latest phase of GUDMAP, GUDMAP3. As of April 15, 2018, the website now reflects an updated, clean design and a brand new browsing interface. The GUDMAP repository has also been integrated with the new kidney repository from the ReBuilding a Kidney (RBK) Consortium, with more new protocols, antibody validation data and sequencing data.

Click any of the data links on the homepage or in the navigation bar (under the "Data" menu) and you'll enter the new Data Browser.

The GUDMAP Hub has been working hard to update the underlying data model to provide more linkages between data, better vocabulary integration and improved visualizations. We are still putting the finishing touches on some of the new data features and visualizations so expect the website to continue to evolve.

We've made a [few videos](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/gudmap-rbk/wiki/Using-the-GUDMAP-RBK-Data-Browser) to help you get acquainted with the new site. Start with the [general overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBgHkdFLfp4&t=5s), then continue for [video tutorials by data type](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/gudmap-rbk/wiki/Using-the-GUDMAP-RBK-Data-Browser). More videos will be added as we continue to develop GUDMAP as an unparalleled resource for genitourinary research.

We always want to hear from our users. Please [click this link](https://isrd.wufoo.com/forms/s11zsu750g4r50y/), click the _Feedback_ link found on every page or just send us an email at [help@gudmap.org](mailto:help@gudmap.org).
