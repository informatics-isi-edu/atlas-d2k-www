**Dr. Hunter Wessells**, urologist and chairman of the Department of Urology at the University of Washington, will describe the use of surveys and other information-gathering tools among patients in the UroEDIC cohort to phenotype urological complications in type 1 diabetes. He will address the development of these tools and the translation of research findings, specifically those related to male erectile dysfunction, to clinical practice and to broad research priorities for clinical/translational and basic science research. A panel discussion of epidemiological, clinical, and basic science researchers engaged in benign genitourinary research will follow to stimulate and target discussion to understanding how lessons from the UroEDIC study can be adapted to research in other areas of the lower urinary tract.

This is the first of what we hope are quarterly virtual conversations aimed at sharing research tools, techniques, and technologies across disciplines within the broader benign urologic research community.

\* Collaborating for the Advancement of Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology (CAIRIBU) is an umbrella organization that brings together NIDDK-funded investigators devoted exclusively to investigating benign genitourinary diseases and disorders. A primary objective of CAIRIBU is to encourage interdisciplinary interactions and build effective research collaborations that can tackle the most critical questions related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, urolithiasis, bladder disorders, urinary tract infection, pelvic pain, and genitourinary developmental disorders.
