The Chad Vezina group has published a new paper in the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology, [Void spot assay procedural optimization and software for rapid and objective quantification of rodent voiding function, including overlapping urine spots.](/pdf/2018-Wegner-et-al-2018-AJP-Rena.pdf), describing a new tool for objective, consistent, and rapid analysis of mouse void spot assay (VSA) data. [Void Whizzard](http://imagej.net/Void_Whizzard) is a FIJI (ImageJ) plugin that packages macros for image straightening and cropping, background subtraction and thresholding, spotfinding and determination of area, volume and quantity.
