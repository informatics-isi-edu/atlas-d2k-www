On December 6-7, 2017, the NIH and FDA will be hosting a Regenerative Medicine Innovation Workshop.  The meeting will explore the state of regenerative medicine science involving adult stem cells, with a focus on approaches to the development of safe and effective products.

Sessions will emphasize cross-cutting issues with broad applicability to many areas of regenerative medicine clinical research.  Presentations and case studies in specific clinical disciplines will focus on product development and clinical applications.  There will also be regulatory science sessions dedicated to issues and opportunities in preclinical studies and clinical trial development.  Panel discussions will focus on scientific, technical, and operational challenges as well as strategies for enabling major transformative advances and the development of clinical applications using adult stem cells.
