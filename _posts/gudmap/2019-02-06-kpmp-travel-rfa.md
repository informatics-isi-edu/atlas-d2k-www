From the RFA:

>"The consortium would like to encourage wide participation in the KPMP face-to-face meetings held throughout the year. To this end, eligible investigators for this opportunity announcement would be any early-career investigators who are engaged in basic, clinical, or translational research relevant to the goals of the KPMP and are not currently KPMP key personnel. For the purposes of this announcement, early-career investigators include graduate or medical students, post-doctoral fellows, clinical residents and fellows, and junior faculty. Early-career investigators attending the meeting will learn about KPMP protocols in development, scientific technologies to be applied to the interrogation of kidney biopsy tissue, the role of patient engagement in KPMP, and how data management and visualization tools will be applied to the creation of a kidney atlas. It is expected that this opportunity will lead to increased collaborations for the KPMP consortium. All eligible applicants, including past awardees are encouraged to apply. Depending on availability of funds, lower priority may be given to applicants who have received KPMP travel support in the past year."
