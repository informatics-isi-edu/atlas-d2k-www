NIH has issued four Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) for FY 2018 and beyond that solicit investigator-initiated projects within the **Regenerative Medicine Innovation Project (RMIP)** Program.  These solicitations were informed by a multi-disciplinary, multi-sector Roundtable Workshop that NIH convened in December 2017 to explore issues related to product development, regulatory science, and clinical applications.  The FOAs include both funding for clinical trials, as well as preclinical, late stage IND or IDE enabling studies.  The totality of funds available for these awards collectively is up to $28 million.  NIH anticipates making up to 15 awards in total under all the FOAs combined.  **Awards are expected to be made in April 2019**.

Per the mandate under the 21st Century Cures Act, responsive applications will propose clinical research involving adult stem cells.  Responsive applications may propose, for example, research on biologics (e.g., growth factors, cytokines) and biomaterials (e.g., extracellular matrix, scaffolds) that stimulate host adult stem cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and function or otherwise directly act upon adult stems cells to support innate host healing mechanisms, treat disease, and/or restore function.
