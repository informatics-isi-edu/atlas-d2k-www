Yesterday, we launched two exciting new capabilities available on gudmap.org

### Image Annotations

We have extended our 2D image viewer to support the presentation of regions (annotated by GUDMAP consortium members) which overlay the original image. You can then use annotations to see exactly where the region is on the image,  navigate to related data associated with the region, and download a version of the image with selected annotations for use in a presentation. Annotations are sharable and citable data, each is assigned a globally unique, permanent identifier (RID) (see below for more information about RIDs).

When an image includes annotations, a list of anatomical terms are displayed alongside the annotated regions. From here you can:
* Click the eye icon to hide/show annotations which highlights the regions and helps students distinguish between regions..
* Click the anatomical term’s ID to view more details about the term and any available data in the repository.
* Click the Share Annotation icon to view a citable link for that annotation that you can copy and use in a paper or presentation.
* Zoom in/out and pan the image to view the desired section, adjust the annotations visibility to show the specific ones you’re interested in, then you can use Take a Screenshot to download a .jpg file of the results, including scale information.
* To quickly see the image without the annotations, click "None" in the **Display** field.

To see it in action, go to the Data Collection “Featured Image Annotations” here:

### “Go to RID” bar

The GUDMAP Data Browser now displays a “Go to RID” field in the menu bar that lets you navigate directly to a data record using its RID.

A RID (Resource IDentifier) is a permanent, citable, globally unique identifier displayed for every data record in the GUDMAP/RBK repository, much like an Accession number. Such identifiers are a critical part of making data [FAIR (findable, accessable, interoperable, and reusable)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).

This feature is helpful for collaborators and data submitters who tend to refer to and share datasets by their RIDs. They can just paste the RID into the bar and go directly to the desired record page.
