title: (Re)Building a Kidney Consortium (RBK) Opportunity Pool - 2023
---

The (Re)Building a Kidney consortium (RBK) is an initiative funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) that has developed two strategies to address the challenges associated with treating kidney diseases:

1. A “rebuild strategy” that includes de novo kidney fabrication (synthetic kidney) with stem cells and replacement by transplantation, and
2. A “repair strategy” that involves the induction of the innate kidney repair system to stimulate productive in vivo repair/regeneration of nephrons to restore failing kidney function.

The RBK recognizes that collaborations are essential for the RBK to fully achieve the objectives of rebuilding and repairing kidneys. Thus, the ATLAS-D2K Center, the coordinating Hub for the RBK, will administer a funding opportunity to support research efforts that address scientific gaps and challenges identified by the RBK or to form new partnerships. Applications are sought from both internal and external investigators to support collaborative research efforts.

### Funding Opportunity Announcement

The RBK Opportunity Pool (RBK OP) invites investigators to submit applications that, if successful, will become part of the RBK (For more information see [RFA-DK- 19-007](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DK-19-007.html)). The RBK OP aims to support the goals and address keys areas of scientific interest to the RBK through the solicitation of additional projects and/or expertise in specific subject areas that promote collaborative efforts between RBK researchers and/or forge new interactions with the outside community.

This funding opportunity is open to all researchers.

There are several key areas of scientific interest to the RBK which include, but are not limited to, the following:

**Rebuilding strategies**

* Develop standardized protocols and methods that enhance organoid maturation and the production of organoids at scale.
* Develop tests to assess physiologic function(s) of organoids in culture and upon organoid engraftment in vivo.
* Devise novel approaches to successfully connect in vitro generated kidney tissue/organoids engrafted to host collecting duct/ureter and vasculature systems.

**Repair strategies**
* Develop new tools to non-invasively image repair and regeneration.
* Develop mouse reporter lines to study adaptive, maladaptive and failed repair.

### Peer Review

- All applications will be peer-reviewed, and the reviews will be coordinated by the ATLAS-D2K Center and not the NIH/NIDDK.
- Reviewers will score applications based on three scoring criteria:
    - Factor 1: Importance of the Research (Significance and Innovation)
        - Should it be done?
        - Scored (1-9), affects overall impact score
    - Factor 2. Feasibility & Rigor (Approach)
        - Can it be done well?
        - Scored (1-9), affects overall impact score
    - Factor 3: Expertise and Resources (Investigator, Environment)
        - Will it be done?
        - Scored (1-9), affects overall impact score.

- Reviewers will also strongly consider the following review criteria:
    - Does the application address a significant scientific knowledge gap in the RBK?
    - Does the application propose a new collaboration within RBK or form new partnerships with external researchers that will add significant value and help to achieve the goals of RBK?
    - Does the application provide an explicit list of what will be shared, when it will be shared, and how much of it will be shared?
    - Are the proposed milestones, deliverables, and timeline appropriate and feasible?
    - Does the applicant(s) state a willingness to travel key personnel at least once a year to the RBK semi-annual meeting in the Bethesda MD area?
    - Does the applicant(s) state a willingness to adhere to all RBK practices, protocols, and policies including the expectation that participating Institutions are expected to sign-on to the Consortium’s Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Policy.

### Policies

Awardees will become members of the RBK and have the same responsibilities and access to data and results as other RBK awardees and must follow the RBK sharing policies. As such, all awardees and the participating Institution(s) must sign the RBK Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA) and Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) documents. No edits to either the CDA or MTA will be allowed. Per the General Collaborations policy, roles of Collaborators, the RBK Steering Committee will be defined by the original RBK FOAs. As such, collaborators funded by this FOA will not be granted formal membership on the RBK Steering Committee (SC).

### Progress Reports

A written summary of the accomplishments from the funded projects is due at the completion of the funding period.

The NIDDK intends the resource sharing plans for the data and samples generated under the RBK to follow the policy and objectives stated in the original RBK FOAs. Specifically, consistent with achieving the objectives of the RBK, all study data (including, but not limited to, raw data, metadata, digital pathology images, and computational data sets), protocols (including analytical methods), technologies, biological samples (including but not limited to biopsies, nephrectomy tissue, tissue blocks, all slides in any form, blood, urine and stool) and other research resources are to be shared immediately across the consortium, and made publicly available to the larger community as soon as quality control procedures have been completed, and in accordance with RBK SC policies, subject to approval by the NIDDK.

Limited exceptions to the requirement for community dissemination may be identified by the RBK SC and are subject to approval by the NIDDK. The NIDDK, in consultation with the SC for this project, will make all final decisions concerning data and sample deposition and data access policies, and all policies are subject to change by the NIDDK as deemed necessary to sustain program principles and priorities, or to ensure the highest standards for responsible research conduct within the project.

Awardees will comply with and implement the recommendations and decisions of the SC with respect to the sharing of information, data, biosamples, protocols, resources, methods and analyses developed by the RBK investigators under the RBK.

### Acknowledgment

Awardees must acknowledge the RBK in all posters, manuscripts or scientific materials generated in part or whole using funds from the RBK using the following text:
