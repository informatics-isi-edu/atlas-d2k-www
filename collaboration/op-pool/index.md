Opportunity Pools (OPs) are funding opportunities facilitated for GUDMAP and RBK by the ATLAS-D2K Center that invite investigators to submit applications that, if successful, will become part of the consortium. OPs aim to support the goals and address key areas of scientific interest to the consortium through the solicitation of additional projects and/or expertise in specific subject areas that promote collaborative efforts between consortia researchers and/or forge new interactions with the outside community.
