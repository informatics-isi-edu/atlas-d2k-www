Each year, the ATLAS-D2K Center, the coordinating center for the (Re)Building a Kidney (RBK) and GUDMAP Consortiums, will administer a funding opportunity to support research efforts that address scientific gaps and challenges identified by each consortium or to form new partnerships. Applications are sought from both internal and external investigators to support collaborative research efforts.

The 2023 OPP for RBK has closed. We expect to have new OPPs for RBK and GUDMAP announced shortly.
