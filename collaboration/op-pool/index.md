Each year, the ATLAS-D2K Center, the coordinating center for the (Re)Building a Kidney (RBK) and GUDMAP Consortiums, will administer a funding opportunity to support research efforts that address scientific gaps and challenges identified by each consortium or to form new partnerships. Applications are sought from both internal and external investigators to support collaborative research efforts.

Please find details about the current funding opportunity for 2024 here: [Funding Opportunity Announcement - ATLAS-D2K Opportunity Pool 2024](/collaboration/op-pool/2024/).
