title: Apply to become a GUDMAP Collaborating Project

## Collaborating Projects

The GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) is augmented by _Collaborating Projects_, which include funded projects working in areas of high relevance to GUDMAP activities. Principal Investigators (PIs) of such projects may apply for their project to become part of GUDMAP.

The PIs of Collaborating Projects will be closely engaged with the consortium's activities. They will have the same responsibilities (e.g. data contributions) and access to data and results as other GUDMAP PIs. Investigators that are supported under Collaborating Projects are expected to adhere to [Standards of Conduct](NEED), approved by the GUDMAP Steering Committee (SC), and the participating Institutions are expected to sign on to the Consortium’s [Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Policy](NEED). Applications will be considered by the GUDMAP SC, and decisions will be approved by the external GUDMAP Consortium Management Board (CMB).

Eligible projects should be relevant to the [goals of GUDMAP](https://www.gudmap.org/about/), have independent funding, and would be expected to send representatives to GUDMAP’s annual meetings.

[Interested parties should fill out this form](NEED), which will submit the following information to [ATLAS-D2K Team](NEED) for presentation to the GUDMAP Steering Committee:

*   Name(s), address(es), and telephone number(s) of the PD(s)/PI(s)
*   Names of other key personnel
*   Participating institution(s)
*   Title of the funded research project
*   Abstract of the funded research project
*   Project period (i.e., project start and end dates documented in the notice of grant award)
*   Description of the project’s relevance to GUDMAP (how the project would benefit from being part of GUDMAP and how GUDMAP would benefit from collaborating with the project)
