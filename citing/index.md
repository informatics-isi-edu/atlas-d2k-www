## Citation tools in ATLAS-D2K

The ATLAS-D2K Center uses a data citation strategy that has been designed to ensure that all data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (e.g. [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)). As part of this strategy, ATLAS-D2K follows the principles for data citation laid out in [DataCitation](http://blogs.nature.com/scientificdata/2016/07/14/data-citations-at-scientific-data/).

Every data entry in ATLAS-D2K includes a persistent Resource ID (i.e. RID) (e.g. [https://www.atlas-d2k.org/id/W-R812](https://www.atlas-d2k.org/id/W-R812)). This citation, which has the same characteristics as a DOI, may be obtained by clicking the &quot;Share and Cite&quot; button on the upper right-hand part of the page for the data to be referenced.

- "Versioned Link" references the exact instance of this data
- "Live Link" references the current version.
- "Data Citation" displays a citation for the data entry that may be used in a publication.
- "Download Data Citation" allows you to download the citation in BibTex format.

## Creating Citable "Data Collections"

If you are publishing a paper that uses more than one type of ATLAS-D2K data, or you want to aggregate data in new ways, create a new [*Data Collection*](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/gudmap-rbk/wiki/Create-citable-datasets).  Data collections are a curated set of ATLAS-D2K data organized into one easily citable and referenced location with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). This collection allows readers to unambiguously obtain full quality, source data that was referenced in the paper, which promotes reproducibility of scientific results.

If you are an RBK or GUDMAP project publishing a paper, please [create and reference a Data Collection](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/gudmap-rbk/wiki/Create-citable-datasets) for data included in your paper and any additional data you wish to be considered relevant to the published project. Follow the instructions for your consortium ([GUDMAP citation page](/gudmap/citing-gudmap/) and [RBK citation page](/rebuildingakidney/citing/)) on how to add your data citation in the bibliography section, and how to cite your data collection in the manuscript.

Researchers outside of the RBK or GUDMAP may request the creation of a new collection from existing data by emailing [help@atlas-d2k.org](help@atlas-d2k.org).
