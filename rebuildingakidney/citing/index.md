title: How to Cite RBK Data
---

If you're using RBK data, proper citation is crucial. This guide will assist you in correctly referencing the data and the RBK consortium.

## 1. Basic Citation Guidelines:
- Always cite the primary publication linked to the data you used. You can find a comprehensive list of such publications [here](/chaise/recordset/#2/Common:Publication/*::facets::N4IghgdgJiBcDaoDOB7ArgJwMYFM6JHQBcAjdafEAYRQFtaUIQAaEABTRIBsBLLMIj0YB9GhFQZBaWsIBmAaxwBPEAF0AvqwBKASQAia1lgAWKPjiSUAigFoAzAGkArADY16jUA@sort(Year::desc::,Month::desc::,RID::desc::)).

- In addition, please cite the [RBK consortium](#citing-the-RBK-consortium). You can do this using the "Share and cite" button on each data record page or by referencing the provided DOI for a [Data Collection](#creating-citable-data-collections).

## 2. Principles:
The ATLAS-D2K Center adheres to the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data citation strategy, ensuring data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible. Learn more about these principles at [DataCitation](http://blogs.nature.com/scientificdata/2016/07/14/data-citations-at-scientific-data/).

We provide two primary mechanisms for citing data: Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)s provided via [*Data Collections*](#creating-citable-data-collections) and Resource IDs (RIDs) assigned to every data record in the ATLAS-D2K Center.

## Citing the RBK Consortium

If you've leveraged RBK to find data or additional related data, please acknowledge the consortium by citing the following consortium papers:

- Oxburgh L, et al. **(Re)Building a Kidney. J Am Soc Nephrol. 2017 Jan 17. pii: ASN.2016101077.** [View at PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096308).

## Citing Data Associated with a Publication

When citing data, also include the related data DOIs or RIDs (Resource ID). This ensures a clear link between your manuscript and the underlying datasets. Citations should include:

- **Author(s)**
- **Collection title**
- **Year of publication**
- **Repository or publisher** (e.g., (Re)Building a Kidney Consortium)
- **DOI of the dataset**

Here's how to format such citations:
>[1] Benjamin Humphreys <em>(Re)Building a Kidney Consortium</em> <a href="https://doi.org/10.25548/14-4KG6">https://doi.org/10.25548/14-4KG6</a>, (2018).

## Citing Data Not Associated with a Publication

Sometimes, RBK data may be publicly available without a linked publication. In such cases, use the permanent **Resource ID (RID)** assigned by ATLAS-D2K. This citation can be obtained from the "Share and Cite" button on the data page you're referencing.

## Creating Citable Data Collections

If your paper uses or aggregates RBK data in unique ways, consider creating a new *Data Collection*. This allows readers to access the source data directly, promoting reproducibility. Learn how to [create a Data Collection here](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/RBK-rbk/wiki/Create-citable-datasets) or email [help@atlas-d2k.org](mailto:help@atlas-d2k.org) for assistance.

## Data Availability Statements

To comply with journal requirements, always include data accessibility statements in your paper:

>**Data Accessibility**: For transparency and reproducibility, all raw files and data from this study are available at the ATLAS-D2K Center database: [https://doi.org/10.25548/14-4KG6](https://doi.org/10.25548/14-4KG6).

## Links to RBK Resources

Avoid direct links to ATLAS-D2K site pages. Instead, use persistent identifiers like DOIs or RIDs from the "Share and Cite" button.
