<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>
The objective of this proposal is to further develop our novel system of incorporating hPSC-derived UB tissue into kidney organoids to enable fusion of distal nephron epithelium to collecting duct-like tubules. We will define robust protocols and materials for generating these organoids, and we will perform thorough molecular characterization of the developmental processes involved in the anastomosis. Finally, we will determine how fusion to a collecting system impacts the maturation outcomes in kidney organoids in vitro and in vivo.
