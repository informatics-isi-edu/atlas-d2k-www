			<h2>Project Description</h2>

      <p>Our goal is to develop nephron segments using 3D scaffolds as templates for pluripotent stem cells. This project uses extracellular matrix (ECM) to define scaffold-specific elements that drive cell differentiation. We use a high-throughput system of ECM scaffolds to screen conditions favoring differentiation. In this process we identify the requisite matrix-bound elements for differentiation and test the role of ECM remodeling by secondary cell types. Together, this system serves as a model for nephron development within a full-scale kidney scaffold and establishes the requirements for stem cell differentiation within a perfusion bioreactor system. The result of our systematic investigation is to decode critical factors involved in nephron reconstitution, important next steps in tubule repair and renal tissue regeneration.</p>
