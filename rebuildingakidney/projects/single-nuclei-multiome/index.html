<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>
Seeks to investigate mechanisms for kidney tissue regeneration by understanding how gene expression is modified through epigenetic changes in the spiny mouse, a model animal that can regenerate kidney tissue. In completing this proposed research, the milestone to be achieved is a robust dataset that associates regions of open chromatin based on single nuclei ATAC-sequencing with gene expression levels based on single nuclei RNA-sequencing data for individual cell types in a regenerating spiny mouse kidney after ischemia-reperfusion injury.
