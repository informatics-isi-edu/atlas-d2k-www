<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>
We will study the development of proximal tubule cells in kidney organoids and compare these against those found in the human kidney. We will address the question of how to “rebuild a kidney” by completing the following milestones: (1) Delineate genes and regions of DNA that are abnormally regulated in organoids during proximal tubule development and that serve as targets for optimization. (2) Benchmark a new protocol generating HNF4A+ proximal tubule precursors against the framework of in vivo development. (3) Identify common genetic changes in proximal-biased organoids.
