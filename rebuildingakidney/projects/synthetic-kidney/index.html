<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>
1 in 7 Americans suffer from chronic kidney disease, leading some to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 2 in 1000 U.S. adults get ESRD, necessitating dialysis or a kidney transplant. Annually, over $49 billion is spent on ESRD treatment, affecting patients' longevity and life quality. Kidney transplants offer the best survival chance, but donor kidneys are scarce. To address this, this project is introducing a synthetic kidney, engineered using progenitor populations mimicking the embryonic kidney. Once transplanted, this synthetic kidney matures naturally. The decade-long technological advances developed by this lab have enabled the production of essential kidney components, positioning them to address the kidney shortage through this innovative solution.
