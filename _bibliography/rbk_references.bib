  Single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq3) enables high-throughput single-nucleus transcriptomic profiling of multiple samples in one experiment.

abstract = {Summary
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a highly prevalent, heterogeneous syndrome, associated with increased short- and long-term mortality. A multitude of different factors cause AKI including ischemia, sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs, and urinary tract obstruction. Upon injury, the kidney initiates an intrinsic repair program that can result in adaptive repair with regeneration of damaged nephrons and functional recovery of epithelial activity, or maladaptive repair and persistence of damaged epithelial cells with a characteristic proinflammatory, profibrotic molecular signature. Maladaptive repair is linked to disease progression from AKI to chronic kidney disease. Despite extensive efforts, no therapeutic strategies provide consistent benefit to AKI patients. Since kidney biopsies are rarely performed in the acute injury phase in humans, most of our understanding of AKI pathophysiology is derived from preclinical AKI models. This raises the question of how well experimental models of AKI reflect the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human AKI? Here, we provide a brief overview of available AKI models, discuss their strengths and limitations, and consider important aspects of the AKI response in mice and humans, with a particular focus on the role of proximal tubule cells in adaptive and maladaptive repair.}

            Stem cells are enabling an improved understanding of the peripheral arterial disease, and patient-specific stem cell-derived endothelial cells (ECs) present major advantages as a therapeutic modality. However, applications of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs are limited by rapid loss of mature cellular function in culture. We hypothesized that changes in autophagy impact the phenotype and cellular proliferation of iPSC-ECs. Endothelial cells were differentiated from distinct induced pluripotent stem cell lines in 2D culture and purified for CD144 positive cells. Autophagy, mitochondrial morphology, and proliferation were characterized during differentiation and over serial passages in culture. We found that autophagy activity was stimulated during differentiation but stagnated in mature iPSC-ECs. Mitochondria remodeled through mitophagy during differentiation and demonstrated increasing membrane potential and mass through serial passages; however, these plateaued, coinciding with decreased proliferation. To evaluate for oxidative damage, iPSC-ECs were alternatively grown under hypoxic culture conditions; however, hypoxia only transiently improved the proliferation. Stimulating mTOR-independent ULK1-mediated autophagy with a plant derivative AMP kinase activator Rg2 significantly improved proliferative capacity of iPSC-ECs over multiple passages. Therefore, autophagy, a known mediator of longevity, played an active role in remodeling mitochondria during maturation from pluripotency to a terminally differentiated state. Autophagy failed to compensate for increasing mitochondrial mass over serial passages, which correlated with loss of proliferation in iPSC-ECs. Stimulating ULK1-kinase-driven autophagy conferred improved proliferation and longevity over multiple passages in culture. This represents a novel approach to overcoming a major barrier limiting the use of iPSC-ECs for clinical and research applications.},

We analyzed the response of a murine DKD model to five treatment regimens using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Our atlas of ∼1 million cells revealed a heterogeneous response of all kidney cell types both to DKD and its treatment. Both monotherapy and combination therapies targeted differing cell types and induced distinct and non-overlapping transcriptional changes. The early effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on the S1 segment of the proximal tubule suggest that this drug class induces fasting mimicry and hypoxia responses. Diabetes downregulated the spliceosome regulator serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 7 (Srsf7) in proximal tubule that was specifically rescued by SGLT2i. In vitro proximal tubule knockdown of Srsf7 induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype, implicating alternative splicing as a driver of DKD and suggesting SGLT2i regulation of proximal tubule alternative splicing as a potential mechanism of action for this drug class.},

	abstract = {Zebrafish are an established research organism that has made many contributions to our understanding of vertebrate tissue and organ development, yet there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the genes that regulate gonad development, sex, and reproduction. Unlike the development of many organs, such as the brain and heart that form during the first few days of development, zebrafish gonads do not begin to form until the larval stage (≥5 days post-fertilization). Thus, forward genetic screens have identified very few genes required for gonad development. In addition, bulk RNA-sequencing studies that identify genes expressed in the gonads do not have the resolution necessary to define minor cell populations that may play significant roles in the development and function of these organs. To overcome these limitations, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes of cells isolated from juvenile zebrafish ovaries. This resulted in the profiles of 10,658 germ cells and 14,431 somatic cells. Our germ cell data represents all developmental stages from germline stem cells to early meiotic oocytes. Our somatic cell data represents all known somatic cell types, including follicle cells, theca cells, and ovarian stromal cells. Further analysis revealed an unexpected number of cell subpopulations within these broadly defined cell types. To further define their functional significance, we determined the location of these cell subpopulations within the ovary. Finally, we used gene knockout experiments to determine the roles of
              foxl2l

Kidney formation during development is an essential determinant of the final nephron endowment of the adult organ, and no evidence has been reported that mice or humans are able to generate new nephrons after the developmental period. Mechanisms controlling organ growth after development are essential to establish the final adult organ size. The potential for organ growth is maintained in adult life and the size of one kidney may be significantly increased by loss of the contralateral kidney. The mouse has provided a model system for investigators to critically explore genetic, cell biological, and hormonal control of developmental and juvenile kidney growth. This article reviews three basic aspects of kidney size regulation: (1) Mechanisms that control nephron formation and how these are altered by the cessation of nephrogenesis at the end of the developmental period. (2) Applicability of the general model for growth hormone-insulin like growth factor control to kidney growth both pre- and postnatally. (3) Commonalities between mechanisms of juvenile kidney growth and the compensatory growth that is stimulated in adult life by reduction of kidney mass. Understanding the mechanisms that determine set-points for cell numbers and size in the kidney may inform ongoing efforts to generate kidney tissue from stem cells.},

We will assess our general understanding of blood vessel formation, and discuss recent studies of the growing kidney vasculature. Furthermore, we will assess the challenges and limitations faced by organoid technologies, including the difficulties in achieving the patterned vascular network that is essential to organ function.

Here we review assays of physiological function in human kidney organoids, best practices for quality control, and future applications. Tubular structures in organoids accumulate specific molecules through active transport, including dextran and organic anions, and swell with fluid in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate stimulation. When engrafted into animal models in vivo, organoids form vascularized glomerulus-like structures capable of size-selective filtration. Organoids exhibit metabolic, endocrine, injury, and infection phenotypes, although their specificity is not yet fully clear. To properly interpret organoid physiology assays, it is important to incorporate appropriate negative and positive controls, statistical methods, data presentation, molecular mechanisms, and clinical datasets. Improvements in organoid perfusion, patterning, and maturation are needed to enable branching morphogenesis, urine production, and renal replacement.

            Expansion of interstitial cells in the adult kidney is a hallmark of chronic disease, whereas their proliferation during fetal development is necessary for organ formation. An intriguing difference between adult and neonatal kidneys is that the neonatal kidney has the capacity to control interstitial cell proliferation when the target number has been reached. In this study, we define the consequences of inactivating the TGFβ/Smad response in the mouse interstitial cell lineage. We find that pathway inactivation through loss of Smad4 leads to overproliferation of interstitial cells regionally in the kidney medulla. Analysis of markers for BMP and TGFβ pathway activation reveals that loss of Smad4 primarily reduces TGFβ signaling in the interstitium. Whereas TGFβ signaling is reduced in these cells, marker analysis shows that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is increased. Our analysis supports a model in which Wnt/β-catenin-mediated proliferation is attenuated by TGFβ/Smad to ensure that proliferation ceases when the target number of interstitial cells has been reached in the neonatal medulla.},

Loss of nephrons correlates with reduced kidney function, which defines chronic kidney disease (CKD) and confers substantial morbidity and mortality to the worldwide population. Despite the identification of pathways involved in intrinsic repair, limited treatments for CKD exist, partly because of the limited throughput and predictivity of animal studies. Here, we showed that kidney organoids can model the transition from intrinsic to incomplete repair. Single-nuclear RNA sequencing of kidney organoids after cisplatin exposure identified 159 differentially expressed genes and 29 signal pathways in tubular cells undergoing intrinsic repair. Homology-directed repair (HDR) genes including Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (
              FANCD2
              ) and RAD51 recombinase (
              RAD51
              ) were transiently up-regulated during intrinsic repair but were down-regulated in incomplete repair. Single cellular transcriptomics in mouse models of obstructive and hemodynamic kidney injury and human kidney samples of immune-mediated injury validated HDR gene up-regulation during tubular repair. Kidney biopsy samples with tubular injury and varying degrees of fibrosis confirmed loss of FANCD2 during incomplete repair. Last, we performed targeted drug screening that identified the DNA ligase IV inhibitor, SCR7, as a therapeutic candidate that rescued FANCD2/RAD51-mediated repair to prevent the progression of CKD in the cisplatin-induced organoid injury model. Our findings demonstrate the translational utility of kidney organoids to identify pathologic pathways and potential therapies.

            Fingering FANCD2 in tubular repair

              The transition from acute kidney injury, characterized by intrinsic repair, to incomplete repair and chronic damage has been difficult to study. Here, Gupta and colleagues modeled the transition from intrinsic to incomplete repair using human kidney organoids. A single exposure to cisplatin resulted in intrinsic repair, with preserved tubular architecture and up-regulation of genes associated with homology-directed repair, including Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (
              FANCD2
              ). However, with repeated cisplatin exposure,
              FANCD2
              and RAD51 recombinase (
              RAD51
              ) were down-regulated, leading to incomplete repair. The DNA ligase IV inhibitor SCR7 increased FANCD2-mediated repair and ameliorated progression to chronic injury in the organoids, suggesting that targeting the FANCD2/RAD51 pathway may have potential to treat kidney disease.},

While there are multiple approaches to treat the underlying causes of AKI, no targets have been clinically validated. Here, we assessed a series of potent, selective competitive inhibitors of histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8), a promising therapeutic target in an AKI setting. Using biochemical assays, zebrafish AKI phenotypic assays, and human kidney organoid assays, we show that selective HDAC8 inhibitors can lead to efficacy in increasingly stringent models. One of these, PCI-34051, was efficacious in a rodent model of AKI, further supporting the potential for HDAC8 inhibitors and, in particular, this scaffold as a therapeutic approach to AKI.},

This problem is especially apparent in the field of acute kidney injury (AKI), in which clinical trial failures have been attributed to inaccurate modelling performed largely in rodents. Multidisciplinary efforts such as the Kidney Precision Medicine Project are now starting to identify molecular subtypes of human AKI. In addition, over the past decade, there have been developments in human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids as well as zebrafish, rodent and large animal models of AKI. These organoid and AKI models are being deployed at different stages of preclinical therapeutic development. However, the traditionally siloed, preclinical investigator-driven approaches that have been used to evaluate AKI therapeutics to date rarely account for the limitations of the model systems used and have given rise to false expectations of clinical efficacy in patients with different AKI pathophysiologies. To address this problem, there is a need to develop more flexible and integrated approaches, involving teams of investigators with expertise in a range of different model systems, working closely with clinical investigators, to develop robust preclinical evidence to support more focused interventions in patients with AKI.},

	abstract = {Background
              Hemolysis occurs in many injury settings and can trigger disease processes. In the kidney, extracellular hemoglobin can induce damage via several mechanisms. These include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, which promote fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. Understanding the pathophysiology of these injury pathways offers opportunities to develop new therapeutic strategies.


              Methods
              To model hemolysis-induced kidney injury, human kidney organoids were treated with hemin, an iron-containing porphyrin, that generates reactive oxygen species. In addition, we developed an induced pluripotent stem cell line expressing the biosensor, CytochromeC-GFP (CytoC-GFP), which provides a real-time readout of mitochondrial morphology, health, and early apoptotic events.


              Results
              We found that hemin-treated kidney organoids show oxidative damage, increased expression of injury markers, impaired functionality of organic anion and cation transport and undergo fibrosis. Injury could be detected in live CytoC-GFP organoids by cytoplasmic localization of fluorescence. Finally, we show that 4-(phenylthio)butanoic acid, an HDAC inhibitor with anti-fibrotic effects in vivo, reduces hemin-induced human kidney organoid fibrosis.


              Conclusion
              This work establishes a hemin-induced model of kidney organoid injury. This platform provides a new tool to study the injury and repair response pathways in human kidney tissue and will assist in the development of new therapeutics.},

In particular, fibrosis of the kidney and lung are major public health concerns due to their high prevalence and lack of existing treatment options. Here, we harness the pathophysiological features of fibrotic diseases, namely leaky vasculature and aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein deposition (i.e. collagen), to target an anti-fibrotic biologic and a small molecule drug to disease sites of fibrosis, thus improving their therapeutic potential in mouse models of lung and kidney fibrosis. First, we identify and validate collagen-targeting drug delivery systems that preferentially accumulate in the diseased organs: von Willebrand Factor{\textquoteright}s A3 domain (VWF-A3) and decorin-derived collagen-binding peptide-conjugated micelles (CBP-micelles). We then engineer and recombinantly express novel candidate biologic therapies based on the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10: A3-IL-10 and A3-Serum Albumin-IL-10 (A3-SA-IL-10). Simultaneously, we stably encapsulate the potential anti-fibrotic water-insoluble drug, rapamycin, in CBP-micelles. We show that these novel formulations of therapeutics bind to collagen in vitro and that their efficacy in mouse models of lung and kidney fibrosis is improved, compared to free, untargeted drugs. Our results demonstrate that collagen-targeted anti-fibrotic drugs may be next generation therapies of high clinical potential.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Methods We optimized and validated a female bilateral ischemia reperfusion injury model. Using the 10X Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression solution, we generated spatial maps of gene expression across the injury and repair time course, and applied two open-source computational tools, Giotto and SPOTlight, to increase resolution and measure cell-cell interaction dynamics. Results An ischemia time of 34 minutes in a female murine model resulted in comparable injury to 22 minutes for males. We report a total of 16,856 unique genes mapped across injury and repair time course. Giotto, a computational toolbox for spatial data analysis, enabled increased resolution mapping of genes and cell types. Using a seeded non-negative matrix regression (SPOTlight) to deconvolute the dynamic landscape of cell-cell interactions, we find that injured proximal tubule cells are characterized by increasing macrophage and lymphocyte interactions even at 6 weeks after injury, potentially reflecting the AKI to CKD transition.

One promising approach has been  self-organizing organoids, which mimic developmental processes and yield  multicellular, organ-specific tissues. However, a recognized roadblock to this  approach is that many organoid cell types fail to acquire full maturity and  function. Here, we comprehensively assess the vasculature in two distinct kidney  organoid models as well as in explanted embryonic kidneys. Using a variety of  methods, we show that while organoids can develop a wide range of kidney cell types,  as previously shown, endothelial cells (ECs) initially arise but then rapidly  regress over time in culture. Vasculature of cultured embryonic kidneys exhibit  similar regression. By contrast, engraftment of kidney organoids under the kidney  capsule results in the formation of a stable, perfused vasculature that integrates  into the organoid.

	abstract = {Podocytes are critical to maintaining the kidney glomerular filtration barrier. Mutations in genes associated with development of nephrotic syndrome lead to elevated cytoplasmic calcium in podocytes and cause disruption of filtration barrier function. Whether calcium signaling plays a role in the initial formation of the filtration barrier is not known. Using live calcium imaging in two models, larval zebrafish and human kidney organoids, the authors demonstrate that podocyte calcium signaling is active during podocyte differentiation, is podocyte-cell autonomous, occurs independently of neighboring cell types, and is required for foot process and slit diaphragm formation. Their findings also show that developmental calcium signaling occurs by a different mechanism than disease-associated calcium perturbations, and represents a critical regulatory signal for podocyte morphogenesis and filtration barrier formation.Background Podocytes are critical to maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier, and mutations in nephrotic syndrome genes are known to affect podocyte calcium signaling. However, the role of calcium signaling during podocyte development remains unknown.Methods We undertook live imaging of calcium signaling in developing podocytes, using zebrafish larvae and human kidney organoids. To evaluate calcium signaling during development and in response to channel blockers and genetic defects, the calcium biosensor GCaMP6s was expressed in zebrafish podocytes. We used electron microscopy to evaluate filtration barrier formation in zebrafish, and Fluo-4 to detect calcium signals in differentiating podocytes in human kidney organoids.Results Immature zebrafish podocytes (2.5 days postfertilization) generated calcium transients that correlated with interactions with forming glomerular capillaries. Calcium transients persisted until 4 days postfertilization, and were absent after glomerular barrier formation was complete. We detected similar calcium transients in maturing human organoid glomeruli, suggesting a conserved mechanism. In both models, inhibitors of SERCA or IP3 receptor calcium-release channels blocked calcium transients in podocytes, whereas lanthanum was ineffective, indicating the calcium source is from intracellular podocyte endoplasmic-reticulum stores. Calcium transients were not affected by blocking heartbeat or by blocking development of endothelium or endoderm, and they persisted in isolated glomeruli, suggesting podocyte-autonomous calcium release. Inhibition of expression of phospholipase C-γ1, but not nephrin or phospholipase C-ε1, led to significantly decreased calcium activity. Finally, blocking calcium release affected glomerular shape and podocyte foot process formation, supporting the critical role of calcium signaling in glomerular morphogenesis.Conclusions These findings establish podocyte cell–autonomous calcium signaling as a prominent and evolutionarily conserved feature of podocyte differentiation and demonstrate its requirement for podocyte foot process formation.},

	abstract = {Drug-induced nephrotoxicity represents an important cause of acute kidney injury with associated patient morbidity and mortality and is often responsible for  termination of drug development, after extensive resource allocation. We have  developed a human kidney tubuloid system that phenocopies, in 3D culture, kidney  proximal tubules, a primary injury site of most nephrotoxicants. Traditional end  point assays are often performed on 2D cultures of cells that have lost their  differentiated phenotype. Herein, we pair a tubuloid system with Nanoflare (NF) mRNA  nanosensors to achieve a facile, real-time assessment of drug nephrotoxicity. Using  kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) mRNA as a model injury biomarker, we verify NF  specificity in engineered and adenovirus-transfected cells and confirm their  efficacy to report tubular cell injury by aristolochic acid and cisplatin. The  system also facilitates nephrotoxicity screening as demonstrated with 10  representative anticancer moieties. 5-Fluorouracil and paclitaxel induce acute  tubular injury, as reflected by an NF signal increase.},

	abstract = {A single acute kidney injury event increases the risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Combining single-nucleus RNA sequencing with genetic tracing of injured proximal tubule cells identified a spatially dynamic, evolving injury response following ischemia–reperfusion injury. Failed proximal tubule repair leads to the persistence of a profibrotic, proinflammatory Vcam1+/Ccl2+ cell type exhibiting a senescence-associated secretory phenotype and a marked transcriptional activation of NF-κB and AP-1 pathway signatures, but no signs of G2/M cell cycle arrest. Insights from this study can inform strategies to improve renal repair and prevent CKD progression.Acute kidney injury (AKI), commonly caused by ischemia, sepsis, or nephrotoxic insult, is associated with increased mortality and a heightened risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI results in the dysfunction or death of proximal tubule cells (PTCs), triggering a poorly understood autologous cellular repair program. Defective repair associates with a long-term transition to CKD. We performed a mild-to-moderate ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) to model injury responses reflective of kidney injury in a variety of clinical settings, including kidney transplant surgery. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of genetically labeled injured PTCs at 7-d (“early”) and 28-d (“late”) time points post-IRI identified specific gene and pathway activity in the injury–repair transition. In particular, we identified Vcam1+/Ccl2+ PTCs at a late injury stage distinguished by marked activation of NF-κB–, TNF-, and AP-1–signaling pathways. This population of PTCs showed features of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype but did not exhibit G2/M cell cycle arrest, distinct from other reports of maladaptive PTCs following kidney injury. Fate-mapping experiments identified spatially and temporally distinct origins for these cells. At the cortico-medullary boundary (CMB), where injury initiates, the majority of Vcam1+/Ccl2+ PTCs arose from early replicating PTCs. In contrast, in cortical regions, only a subset of Vcam1+/Ccl2+ PTCs could be traced to early repairing cells, suggesting late-arising sites of secondary PTC injury. Together, these data indicate even moderate IRI is associated with a lasting injury, which spreads from the CMB to cortical regions. Remaining failed-repair PTCs are likely triggers for chronic disease progression.The single-nuclei RNA sequencing data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession no. GSE171417). All study data are included in the article and/or supporting information.

The kidney develops from four major  renal progenitor populations: nephron epithelial, ureteric epithelial, interstitial  and endothelial progenitors. Methods have been developed to generate kidney  organoids but few or dispersed tubular clusters within the organoids hamper its use  in regenerative applications. Here, we describe a detailed protocol of asynchronous  mixing of kidney progenitors using organotypic culture conditions to generate kidney  organoids tightly packed with tubular clusters and major renal structures including  endothelial network and functional proximal tubules. This protocol provides guidance  in the culture of human embryonic stem cells from a National Institute of  Health-approved line and their directed differentiation into kidney organoids. Our  18-day protocol provides a rapid method to generate kidney organoids that facilitate  the study of different nephrological events including in vitro tissue development,  disease modeling and chemical screening. However, further studies are required to  optimize the protocol to generate additional renal-specific cell types,  interconnected nephron segments and physiologically functional renal tissues.},

	abstract = {Recent studies demonstrate that metabolic disturbance, such as augmented glycolysis, contributes to fibrosis. The molecular regulation of this metabolic perturbation in  fibrosis, however, has been elusive. COUP-TFII (also known as NR2F2) is an important  regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. Its contribution to organ fibrosis is  undefined. Here, we found increased COUP-TFII expression in myofibroblasts in human  fibrotic kidneys, lungs, kidney organoids, and mouse kidneys after injury. Genetic  ablation of COUP-TFII in mice resulted in attenuation of injury-induced kidney  fibrosis. A non-biased proteomic study revealed the suppression of fatty acid  oxidation and the enhancement of glycolysis pathways in COUP-TFII overexpressing  fibroblasts. Overexpression of COUP-TFII in fibroblasts also induced production of  alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and collagen 1. Knockout of COUP-TFII decreased  glycolysis and collagen 1 levels in fibroblasts. Chip-qPCR revealed the binding of  COUP-TFII on the promoter of PGC1α. Overexpression of COUP-TFII reduced the cellular  level of PGC1α. Targeting COUP-TFII serves as a novel treatment approach for  mitigating fibrosis in chronic kidney disease and potentially fibrosis in other  organs.},

Various approaches and methods have been developed to improve the structure and function of bioengineered kidneys. Assessments of functional properties confirm the adequacy of bioengineered kidneys for multipurpose translational applications. This review is to summarize the studies performed in kidney bioengineering in the past decade. We identified 84 original articles from PubMed and Mendeley with keywords of kidney organoid or kidney tissue engineering. Those were categorized into 5 groups based on their approach: de-/recellularization of kidney, reaggregation of kidney cells, kidney organoids, kidney in scaffolds, and kidney-on-a-chip. These models were physiologically assessed by filtration, tubular reabsorption/secretion, hormone production, and nephrotoxicity. We found that bioengineered kidney models have been developed from simple cell cultures to multicellular systems to recapitulate kidney function and diseases. Meanwhile, only about 50\\% of these studies conducted functional assessments on their kidney models. Factors including cell composition and organization are likely to alter the applicability of physiological assessments in bioengineered kidneys. Combined with recent technologies, physiological assessments importantly contribute to the improvement of the bioengineered kidney model toward repairing and refunctioning the damaged kidney.}",

Such injury can be ameliorated by genetic ablation of the KIM-1  mucin domain in a high-fat-fed streptozotocin mouse model of DKD. We also identified  TW-37 as a small molecule inhibitor of KIM-1-mediated PA-albumin uptake and showed  in vivo in a kidney injury model in mice that it ameliorates renal inflammation and  fibrosis.

  abstract = {Abstract Nonclinical testing has served as a foundation for evaluating potential risks and effectiveness of investigational new drugs in humans. However, the current two-dimensional (2D) in vitro cell culture systems cannot accurately depict and simulate the rich environment and complex processes observed in vivo, whereas animal studies present significant drawbacks with inherited species-specific differences and low throughput for increased demands. To improve the nonclinical prediction of drug safety and efficacy, researchers continue to develop novel models to evaluate and promote the use of improved cell- and organ-based assays for more accurate representation of human susceptibility to drug response. Among others, the three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models present physiologically relevant cellular microenvironment and offer great promise for assessing drug disposition and pharmacokinetics (PKs) that influence drug safety and efficacy from an early stage of drug development. Currently, there are numerous different types of 3D culture systems, from simple spheroids to more complicated organoids and organs-on-chips, and from single-cell type static 3D models to cell co-culture 3D models equipped with microfluidic flow control as well as hybrid 3D systems that combine 2D culture with biomedical microelectromechanical systems. This article reviews the current application and challenges of 3D culture systems in drug PKs, safety, and efficacy assessment, and provides a focused discussion and regulatory perspectives on the liver-, intestine-, kidney-, and neuron-based 3D cellular models.},

Organoids contain proximal and distal tubules as well as podocytes, in addition to a variety of other lineages such as endothelial cells. Organoid technology has great potential for kidney regeneration and has already been proven to be suitable for modeling kidney disease. However, the methodologies that are used for the generation of kidney organoids require expertise and can be daunting for the inexperienced. Here, we describe in detail a well-established and relatively simple method for the generation of human kidney organoids. We include notes on technical and design considerations for these experiments, and highlight key advantages and limitations of the system.},

However, the limited scale, incomplete cellular complexity and functional immaturity of such structures suggests we are some way from this goal. While developmental biology has successfully guided advances to date, these human kidney models are limited in their capacity for ongoing nephrogenesis and lack corticomedullary definition, a unified vasculature and a coordinated exit path for urinary filtrate. This review will reassess our developmental understanding of how the mammalian embryo manages to create kidneys, how this has informed our progress to date and how both engineering and developmental biology can continue to guide us towards a synthetic kidney."

  During development, distinct progenitors contribute to the nephrons versus the ureteric epithelium of the kidney. Indeed, previous human pluripotent stem-cell-derived models of kidney tissue either contain nephrons or pattern specifically to the ureteric epithelium. By re-analyzing the transcriptional distinction between distal nephron and ureteric epithelium in human fetal kidney, we show here that, while existing nephron-containing kidney organoids contain distal nephron epithelium and no ureteric epithelium, this distal nephron segment alone displays significant in vitro plasticity and can adopt a ureteric epithelial tip identity when isolated and cultured in defined conditions. “Induced” ureteric epithelium cultures can be cryopreserved, serially passaged without loss of identity, and transitioned toward a collecting duct fate. Cultures harboring loss-of-function mutations in PKHD1 also recapitulate the cystic phenotype associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease."

We demonstrate that manual organoid generation can be replaced by 6- or 96-well organoid bioprinting and evaluate the relative toxicity of aminoglycosides as a proof of concept for drug testing. In addition, three-dimensional bioprinting enables precise manipulation of biophysical properties, including organoid size, cell number and conformation, with modification of organoid conformation substantially increasing nephron yield per starting cell number. This facilitates the manufacture of uniformly patterned kidney tissue sheets with functional proximal tubular segments. Hence, automated extrusion-based bioprinting for kidney organoid production delivers improvements in throughput, quality control, scale and structure, facilitating in vitro and in vivo applications of stem cell-derived human kidney tissue.},

There is a long-held belief that interactions between progenitors of the collecting ducts and nephrons are primarily responsible for kidney development. However, over the last several years, it has become increasingly clear that multiple aspects of kidney development require signaling from the interstitium. How the interstitium orchestrates these various roles is poorly understood. Here, we show that during development the interstitium is a highly heterogeneous patterned population of cells that occupies distinct positions correlated to the adjacent parenchyma. Our analysis indicates that the heterogeneity is not a mere reflection of different stages in a linear developmental trajectory but instead represents several novel differentiated cell states. Further, we find that β-catenin has a cell autonomous role in the development of a medullary subset of the interstitium and that this non-autonomously affects the development of the adjacent epithelia. These findings suggest the intriguing possibility that the different interstitial subtypes may create microenvironments that play unique roles in development of the adjacent epithelia and endothelia.},

    abstract = { The cortical collecting duct (CCD) of the mammalian kidney plays a major role in the maintenance of total body electrolyte, acid/base, and fluid homeostasis by tubular reabsorption and excretion. The mammalian CCD is heterogeneous, composed of Na+-absorbing principal cells (PCs) and acid-base-transporting intercalated cells (ICs). Perturbations in luminal flow rate alter hydrodynamic forces to which these cells in the cylindrical tubules are exposed. However, most studies of tubular ion transport have been performed in cell monolayers grown on or epithelial sheets affixed to a flat support, since analysis of transepithelial transport in native tubules by in vitro microperfusion requires considerable expertise. Here, we report on the generation and characterization of an in vitro, perfusable three-dimensional kidney CCD model (3D CCD), in which immortalized mouse PC-like mpkCCD cells are seeded within a cylindrical channel embedded within an engineered extracellular matrix and subjected to luminal fluid flow. We find that a tight epithelial barrier composed of differentiated and polarized PCs forms within 1 wk. Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals the apical epithelial Na+ channel ENaC and basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase. On cessation of luminal flow, benzamil-inhibitable cell doming is observed within these 3D CCDs consistent with the presence of ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption. Our 3D CCD provides a geometrically and microphysiologically relevant platform for studying the development and physiology of renal tubule segments. }

Asynchronous mixing promoted nephrogenesis, and heterochronic organoids  were well vascularized when engrafted under the kidney capsule. Micro-CT and  injection of a circulating vascular marker demonstrated that engrafted kidney tissue  was connected to the systemic circulation by 2 weeks after engraftment. Proximal  tubule glucose uptake was confirmed, but despite these promising measures of graft  function, overgrowth of stromal cells prevented long-term study.

Although use of this approach is not an option for studying human development in vivo, its application in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is now feasible.Methods We used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate ten fluorescence reporter iPSC lines designed to identify nephron progenitors, podocytes, proximal and distal nephron, and ureteric epithelium.

To obtain a more complete picture of gene expression in the proximal tubule, the authors performed deep translational profiling of this segment in a mouse model of kidney fibrosis. Their findings demonstrate substantial sex differences in transcripts expressed in proximal tubule cells of males versus females, and indicate that the proximal tubule drives fibrosis through inflammatory and profibrotic paracrine signaling. The study also identified 439 long noncoding RNAs expressed in the proximal tubule, 143 of which undergo differential regulation in fibrosis, suggesting that this type of RNA has unanticipated regulatory roles kidney fibrosis.Background Proximal tubule injury can initiate CKD, with progression rates that are approximately 50\% faster in males versus females. The precise transcriptional changes in this nephron segment during fibrosis and potential differences between sexes remain undefined.Methods We generated mice with proximal tubule{\textendash}specific expression of an L10a ribosomal subunit protein fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein. We performed unilateral ureteral obstruction surgery on four male and three female mice to induce inflammation and fibrosis, collected proximal tubule{\textendash}specific and bulk cortex mRNA at day 5 or 10, and sequenced samples to a depth of 30 million reads. We applied computational methods to identify sex-biased and shared molecular responses to fibrotic injury, including up- and downregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and transcriptional regulators, and used in situ hybridization to validate critical genes and pathways.Results We identified \&gt;17,000 genes in each proximal tubule group, including 145 G-protein{\textendash}coupled receptors.

Interestingly, organoid-generated podocytes exhibited highly similar, progressive transcriptional profiles despite an absence of the vasculature, although abnormal gene expression was pinpointed in late podocytes.  On transplantation into mice, organoid-derived podocytes recruited the host vasculature and partially corrected transcriptional profiles.

Although adult kidney progenitor cells have been characterized by transplantation and single cell RNA seq, signals that stimulate new nephron formation are not known. Here we demonstrate that fibroblast growth factors and FGF signaling is rapidly induced after kidney injury and that FGF signaling is required for recruitment of progenitor cells to  sites of new nephron formation. Chemical or dominant negative blockade of Fgfr1 prevented formation of nephron progenitor cell aggregates after injury and during kidney development. Implantation of FGF soaked beads induced local aggregation of lhx1a:EGFP + kidney progenitor cells. Our results reveal a previously unexplored  role for FGF signaling in recruitment of renal progenitors to sites of new nephron formation and suggest a role for FGF signaling in maintaining cell adhesion and cell polarity in newly forming kidney epithelia.},

The small amount of tissue obtained by renal biopsy has previously limited the ability to use patient samples for discovery purposes. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is an ideal technology for quantitative interrogation of scarce samples, permitting concurrent analysis of more than 40 markers on a single tissue section. Using a validated panel of metal-conjugated antibodies designed to confer unique signatures on the structural and infiltrating cells comprising the human kidney, we performed simultaneous multiplexed imaging with IMC in 23 channels on 16 histopathologically normal human samples. We devised a machine-learning pipeline (Kidney-MAPPS) to perform single-cell segmentation, phenotyping, and quantification, thus creating a spatially preserved quantitative atlas of the normal human kidney. These data define selected baseline renal cell types, respective numbers, organization, and variability. We demonstrate the utility of IMC coupled to Kidney-MAPPS to qualitatively and quantitatively distinguish individual cell types and reveal expected as well as potentially novel abnormalities in diseased versus normal tissue. Our studies define a critical baseline data set for future quantitative analysis of human kidney disease.},

The therapy of choice is kidney replacement, but availability of organs is limited, and alternative sources of tissue are needed. Generation of new kidney tissue in the laboratory has been made possible through pluripotent cell reprogramming and directed differentiation. In current procedures, aggregates of  cells known as organoids are grown either submerged or at the air-liquid interface. These studies have demonstrated that kidney tissue can be generated from pluripotent stem cells, but they also identify limitations. The first is that perfusion of cell aggregates is limited, restricting the size to which they  can be grown. The second is that aggregates lack the structural integrity required for convenient engraftment and suturing or adhesion to regions of kidney injury. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of silk to serve as a support for the growth and differentiation of kidney tissue from primary cells and from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We find that cells can differentiate to epithelia characteristic of the developing kidney on this material and that these structures are maintained following engraftment under the capsule of the adult kidney. Blood vessel investment can be promoted by the addition of vascular endothelial growth factor to the scaffold, but the proliferation of stromal cells within the graft presents a challenge, which will require some readjustment of cell growth and differentiation conditions. In summary, we find that silk can be  used to support growth of stem cell derived kidney tissue.},

Despite the presence or absence of doxycycline, podocytes cannot label with tdTomato, but are constitutively labeled with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter (green). Only activation of the Nphs1-FLPo transgene by labeled parietal epithelial cells can generate a yellow color. At day 28 of experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, podocyte density was 20\% lower in 20\% of glomeruli. At day 56 of experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, podocyte density was 18\% lower in 17\% of glomeruli. TdTomato+ parietal epithelial cells were restricted to Bowman?s capsule in healthy mice. However, by days 28 and 56 of experimental disease, two-thirds of tdTomato+ parietal epithelial cells within glomerular tufts were yellow in color. These cells co-expressed the podocyte markers podocin, nephrin, p57 and VEGF164, but not markers of endothelial (ERG) or mesangial (Perlecan) cells. Expansion microscopy showed primary, secondary and minor processes in tdTomato+EGFP+ cells in glomerular tufts.

New nephron aggregates are patterned by Wnt signaling, with high canonical Wnt-signaling cells forming a single cell thick rosette that demarcates: domains of cell proliferation in the elongating nephron; and tubule fusion where the new nephron plumbs into the distal tubule and establishes blood filtrate drainage. Pharmacological blockade of canonical Wnt signaling inhibited new nephron formation after injury by inhibiting cell proliferation, and resulted in loss of polarized rosette structures in the aggregates. Mutation in frizzled9b reduced total kidney nephron number, caused defects in tubule morphology and reduced regeneration of new nephrons after injury. Our results demonstrate an essential role for Wnt/frizzled signaling in adult zebrafish kidney development and regeneration, highlighting conserved mechanisms underlying both mammalian kidney development and kidney stem cell-directed neonephrogenesis in zebrafish.},

Lineage tracing studies in mice identified a self‐renewing Six2‐expressing nephron progenitor population able to give rise to the full complement of nephrons throughout kidney morphogenesis. To investigate the origin of nephrons within human pluripotent stem cell‐derived kidney organoids, we performed a similar fate‐mapping analysis of the SIX2‐expressing lineage in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)‐derived kidney organoids to explore the feasibility of investigating lineage relationships in differentiating iPSCs in vitro. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene‐edited lineage reporter lines, we show that SIX2‐expressing cells give rise to nephron epithelial cell types but not to presumptive ureteric epithelium. The use of an inducible (CreERT2) line revealed a declining capacity for SIX2+ cells to contribute to nephron formation over time, but retention of nephron‐forming capacity if provided an exogenous WNT signal. Hence, while human iPSC‐derived kidney tissue appears to maintain lineage relationships previously identified in developing mouse kidney, unlike the developing kidney in vivo, kidney organoids lack a nephron progenitor niche capable of both self‐renewal and ongoing nephrogenesis.EMBO Reports (2019) e47483},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A challenge for single-cell genomic studies in kidney and other solid tissues is generating a high-quality single-cell suspension that contains rare or difficult-to-dissociate cell types and is free of both RNA degradation and artifactual transcriptional stress responses. METHODS: We compared single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using the DropSeq platform with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using sNuc-DropSeq, DroNc-seq, and 10X Chromium platforms  on adult mouse kidney. We validated snRNA-seq on fibrotic kidney from mice 14 days after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery. RESULTS: A total of 11,391 transcriptomes were generated in the comparison phase. We identified ten clusters in the scRNA-seq dataset, but glomerular cell types were absent, and one cluster consisted primarily of artifactual dissociation-induced stress response genes. By contrast, snRNA-seq from all three platforms captured a diversity of kidney cell types that were not represented in the scRNA-seq dataset, including glomerular podocytes, mesangial cells, and endothelial cells. No stress response  genes were detected. Our snRNA-seq protocol yielded 20-fold more podocytes compared with published scRNA-seq datasets (2.4\% versus 0.12\%, respectively). Unexpectedly, single-cell and single-nucleus platforms had equivalent gene detection sensitivity. For validation, analysis of frozen day 14 UUO kidney revealed rare juxtaglomerular cells, novel activated proximal tubule and fibroblast cell states, and previously unidentified tubulointerstitial signaling  pathways. CONCLUSIONS: snRNA-seq achieves comparable gene detection to scRNA-seq  in adult kidney, and it also has substantial advantages, including reduced dissociation bias, compatibility with frozen samples, elimination of dissociation-induced transcriptional stress responses, and successful performance on inflamed fibrotic kidney.},

	abstract = {Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by damage to both the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium, but relatively little is known about accompanying cell-specific changes in gene expression. We performed unbiased single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) on cryopreserved human diabetic kidney samples to generate 23,980 single nucleus transcriptomes from three control and three early diabetic nephropathy samples. All major cell types of the kidney were represented in the final dataset. Side by side comparison demonstrated cell-type-specific changes in gene expression that are important for ion transport, angiogenesis, and immune cell activation. In particular, we show that the diabetic loop of Henle, late distal convoluted tubule, and principal cells all adopt a gene expression signature consistent with increased potassium secretion, including alterations in Na-K+-ATPase, WNK1, mineralocorticoid receptor and NEDD4L expression, as well as decreased paracellular calcium and magnesium reabsorption. We also identify strong angiogenic signatures in glomerular cell types, proximal convoluted tubule, distal convoluted tubule and principal cells. Taken together, these results suggest that increased potassium secretion and angiogenic signaling represent early kidney responses in human diabetic nephropathy.Significance Statement Single nucleus RNA sequencing revealed gene expression changes in early diabetic nephropathy that promote urinary potassium secretion and decreased calcium and magnesium reabsorption. Multiple cell types exhibited angiogenic signatures, which may represent early signs of aberrant angiogenesis. These alterations may help to identify biomarkers for disease progression or signaling pathways amenable to early intervention.},

Outstanding challenges exist, however, in reconstructing the complex architecture, cellular make-up, and matrix composition necessary for the proper modeling of kidney function. Herein, the first fully tunable human kidney-on-a-chip platform is reported that allows the reconstruction of the native architecture of the renal endothelial-epithelial exchange interface using entirely cell-remodelable matrix and patient-derived kidney cells. This platform consists of a double-layer human renal vascular-tubular unit (hRVTU) enabled by a thin collagen membrane that replicates the kidney exchange interface. It is shown that endothelial and epithelial cells  lining their respective lumens remodel the membrane in culture into a approximately 1 microm thick exchange interface composed of native basement membrane proteins. This interface displays sufficient mechanical integrity for media flow and blood perfusion. As a proof of principle, it is demonstrated that  the hRVTU performs kidney-specific functions including reabsorption of albumin and glucose from the epithelial channel. By incorporating multiple cell populations from single donors, it is demonstrated that the hRVTU may have utility for future precision medicine applications. The success of the system provides new opportunities for the next generation of organ-on-a-chip models.},

Using a genetic strategy with positive and negative selection, we isolated Kidney-Gli1 (KG1) cells that maintain expression of appropriate mesenchymal stem cell-like cell markers, respond to hedgehog pathway activation and display robust myofibroblast differentiation upon treatment with TGFb. Co-culture of KG1 cells with endothelium stabilizes capillary formation. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis during differentiation identified autocrine ligand-receptor pair upregulation and a strong focal adhesion pathway signal. This led us to test the serum response factor inhibitor CCG-203971 which potently inhibited TGFb-induced pericyte to myofibroblast transition. scRNA-seq also identified the unexpected upregulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) which we confirmed in two mouse kidney fibrosis models. The Ngf receptor Ntrk1 is expressed in tubular epithelium in vivo, suggesting a novel interstitial to tubule paracrine signaling axis. Thus KG1 cells accurately model myofibroblast activation in vitro, and the development of this cell line provides a new tool to study resident mesenchymal stem cell-like progenitors in health and disease.},

Acutely injured genetically labeled clones co-expressed Kim-1, Vimentin, Sox9 and Ki67, indicating a dedifferentiated and proliferative state. Clonal analysis revealed clonal expansion of Kim-1+ cells, indicating that acutely injured, dedifferentiated proximal tubule cells account for repair rather than a fixed tubular progenitor. Translational profiling during injury and repair revealed signatures of both successful and unsuccessful maladaptive repair. The transcription factor FoxM1 was induced early in injury, was required for epithelial proliferation, and was dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) stimulation. In conclusion, dedifferentiated proximal tubule cells effect proximal tubule repair and we reveal a novel EGFR-FoxM1-dependent signaling pathway that drives proliferative repair after injury.},

In order to shed light on human kidney development, we have used single-cell transcriptomics to characterize gene expression in different cell populations, and to study individual cell dynamics and lineage trajectories during development. Single-cell transcriptome analyses of 6414 cells from five individual specimens identified 11 initial clusters of specific renal cell types as defined by their gene expression profile. Further subclustering identifies progenitors, and mature and intermediate stages of differentiation for several renal lineages. Other lineages identified include mesangium, stroma, endothelial and immune cells. Novel markers for these cell types were revealed in the analysis, as were components of key signaling pathways driving renal development in animal models.

By contrast, the techniques used to analyze renal biopsy specimens have changed little over several decades. We tested the hypothesis that single-cell RNA-sequencing can comprehensively describe cell types and states in a human kidney biopsy specimen.

Methods We generated 8746 single-cell transcriptomes from a healthy adult kidney and a single kidney transplant biopsy core by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the biopsy specimen was performed to identify 16 distinct cell types, including all of the major immune cell types and most native kidney cell types, in this biopsy specimen, for which the histologic read was mixed rejection.

Results Monocytes formed two subclusters representing a nonclassical CD16+ group and a classic CD16− group expressing dendritic cell maturation markers. The presence of both monocyte cell subtypes was validated by staining of independent transplant biopsy specimens. Comparison of healthy kidney epithelial transcriptomes with biopsy specimen counterparts identified novel segment-specific proinflammatory responses in rejection. Endothelial cells formed three distinct subclusters: resting cells and two activated endothelial cell groups. One activated endothelial cell group expressed Fc receptor pathway activation and Ig internalization genes, consistent with the pathologic diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection. We mapped previously defined genes that associate with rejection outcomes to single cell types and generated a searchable online gene expression database.

Conclusions We present the first step toward incorporation of single-cell transcriptomics into kidney biopsy specimen interpretation, describe a heterogeneous immune response in mixed rejection, and provide a searchable resource for the scientific community.},

Using enhanced episomal-based reprogramming and CRISPR/Cas9 systems, gene-edited and passage-matched unmodified iPSC lines are obtained following a single electroporation of human fibroblasts. To minimize unwanted mutations within the target locus, we use a Cas9 variant that is associated with decreased nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity.

To carry out these diverse functions, the vasculature is regionalized within the kidney and along the nephron. However, when and how endothelial regionalization occurs remains unknown. Here, we examine the developing kidney vasculature to assess its 3-dimensional structure and transcriptional heterogeneity. First, we observe that endothelial cells (ECs) grow coordinately with the kidney bud as early as E10.5, and begin to show signs of speci cation by E13.5 when the  rst arteries can be identi ed. We then focus on how ECs pattern and remodel with respect to the developing nephron and collecting duct epithelia. ECs circumscribe nephron progenitor populations at the distal tips of the ureteric bud (UB) tree and form stereotyped cruciform structures around each tip. Beginning at the renal vesicle (RV) stage, ECs form a continuous plexus around developing nephrons. The endothelial plexus envelops and elaborates with the maturing nephron, becoming preferentially enriched along the early distal tubule. Lastly, we perform transcriptional and immuno uorescent screens to characterize spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the kidney vasculature and identify novel regionally enriched genes. A better understanding of development of the kidney vasculature will help instruct engineering of properly vascularized ex vivo kidneys and evaluate diseased kidneys.},

To overcome this we developed a new tool to simultaneously fate map two distinct cell types in the kidney, and genetically test whether cells of renin lineage (CoRL) can transdifferentiate to a podocyte fate. Ren1cCreER/ tdTomato/Nphs1-FLPo/FRT-EGFP mice (CoRL-PODO mice) were generated by crossing Ren1c-CreER/tdTomato CoRL reporter mice with Nphs1-FLPo/FRT-EGFP podocyte reporter mice. Following tamoxifen administration in these animals, CoRL were labeled with red fluorescence (tdTomato) and co-localized with renin. Podocytes were labeled green (enhanced green fluorescent protein) and co-localized with nephrin. Following podocyte loss by nephrotoxic antibody and subsequent enalapril-enhanced partial replacement, tdTomato-EGFP-labeled CoRL were detected as yellow- colored cells in a subset of glomerular tufts, without the use of antibodies. Co-localization with podocin indicated that these cells are podocytes, derived from CoRL origin. Thus, our novel study shows that two distinct cell types can be simultaneously labeled in the mouse kidney and provide strong genetic evidence in vivo that lost podocytes can be replaced in part by CoRL.},

	abstract = {Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived kidney organoids may facilitate disease modeling and the generation of tissue for renal replacement. Long-term application, however, will require transferability between hPSC lines and significant improvements in organ maturation. A key question is whether time or a patent vasculature is required for ongoing morphogenesis. Here, we show that hPSC-derived kidney organoids, derived in fully defined medium conditions and in the absence of any exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor, develop host-derived vascularization. In vivo imaging of organoids under the kidney capsule confirms functional glomerular perfusion as well as connection to pre-existing vascular networks in the organoids. Wide-field electron microscopy demonstrates that transplantation results in formation of a glomerular basement membrane, fenestrated endothelial cells, and podocyte foot processes. Furthermore, compared with non-transplanted organoids, polarization and segmental specialization of tubular epithelium are observed. These data demonstrate that functional vascularization is required for progressive morphogenesis of human kidney organoids.},

	abstract = {Human kidney function is underpinned by approximately 1,000,000 nephrons, although the number varies substantially, and low nephron number is linked to disease. Human kidney development initiates around 4 weeks of gestation and ends around 34-37 weeks of gestation. Over this period, a reiterative inductive process establishes the nephron complement. Studies have provided insightful anatomic descriptions of human kidney development, but the limited histologic views are not readily accessible to a broad audience. In this first paper in a series providing comprehensive insight into human kidney formation, we examined human kidney development in 135 anonymously donated human kidney specimens. We documented kidney development at a macroscopic and cellular level through histologic analysis, RNA in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence studies, and transcriptional profiling, contrasting human development (4-23 weeks) with mouse development at selected stages (embryonic day 15.5 and postnatal day 2). The high-resolution histologic interactive atlas of human kidney organogenesis generated can be viewed at the GUDMAP database (www.gudmap.org) together with three-dimensional reconstructions of key components of the data herein. At the anatomic level, human and mouse kidney development differ in timing, scale, and global features such as lobe formation and progenitor niche organization. The data also highlight differences in molecular and cellular features, including the expression and cellular distribution of anchor gene markers used to identify key cell types in mouse kidney studies. These data will facilitate and inform in vitro efforts to generate human kidney structures and comparative functional analyses across mammalian species.},

	abstract = {The renal biopsy provides critical diagnostic and prognostic information to clinicians including cases of acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and allograft dysfunction. Today, biopsy specimens are read using a combination of light microscopy, electron microscopy, and indirect immunofluorescence, with a limited number of antibodies. These techniques all were perfected decades ago with only incremental changes since then. By contrast, recent advances in single-cell genomics are transforming scientists' ability to characterize cells. Rather than measure the expression of several genes at a time by immunofluorescence, it now is possible to measure the expression of thousands of genes in thousands of single cells simultaneously. Here, we argue that the development of single-cell RNA sequencing offers an opportunity to describe human kidney disease comprehensively at a cellular level. It is particularly well suited for the analysis of immune cells, which are characterized by multiple subtypes and changing functions depending on their environment. In this review, we summarize the development of single-cell RNA sequencing methodologies. We discuss how these approaches are being applied in other organs, and the potential for this powerful technology to transform our understanding of kidney disease once applied to the renal biopsy.},

Despite recent advances, the process of transdifferentiation of CoRL to podocytes is poorly understood. In this study, we employed a transgenic reporter mouse line which permanently labels CoRL with ZsGreen fluorescent protein, allowing for isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. At 5 days following induction of abrupt podocyte ablation via anti-podocyte sheep IgG, mice were sacrificed and CoRL were isolated by FACS. RNA was subsequently analyzed by microarray. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed and revealed that CoRL display a distinct phenotype following podocyte ablation, primarily consisting of downregulation of metabolic processes and upregulation of immuno-modulatory processes. Additionally, RNA-biology and cell cycle-related processes were also upregulated. Changes in gene expression or activity of a core set of transcription factors including HNF1 and E2F were identified through changes in enrichment of their respective target genes. However, integration of results from transcription factor and canonical pathway analysis indicated that ERR1 and PU-box family members may be the major contributors to the post-podocyte ablation phenotype of CoRL. Finally, top ranking genes were selected from the microarray-based analysis and confirmed by qPCR. Collectively, our results provide valuable insights into the transcriptional regulation of CoRL following abrupt podocyte ablation.},

	abstract = {A critical event during kidney organogenesis is the differentiation of podocytes, specialized epithelial cells that filter blood plasma to form urine. Podocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-podocytes) have recently been generated in nephron-like kidney organoids, but the developmental stage of these cells and their capacity to reveal disease mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we show that hPSC-podocytes phenocopy mammalian podocytes at the capillary loop stage (CLS), recapitulating key features of ultrastructure, gene expression, and mutant phenotype. hPSC-podocytes in vitro progressively establish junction-rich basal membranes (nephrin+ podocin+ ZO-1+ ) and microvillus-rich apical membranes (podocalyxin+ ), similar to CLS podocytes in vivo. Ultrastructural, biophysical, and transcriptomic analysis of podocalyxin-knockout hPSCs and derived podocytes, generated using CRISPR/Cas9, reveals defects in the assembly of microvilli and lateral spaces between developing podocytes, resulting in failed junctional migration. These defects are phenocopied in CLS glomeruli of podocalyxin-deficient mice, which cannot produce urine, thereby demonstrating that podocalyxin has a conserved and essential role in mammalian podocyte maturation. Defining the maturity of hPSC-podocytes and their capacity to reveal and recapitulate pathophysiological mechanisms establishes a powerful framework for studying human kidney disease and regeneration.

	abstract = {Recent advances in our capacity to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to human kidney tissue are moving the field closer to novel approaches for renal replacement. Such protocols have relied upon our current understanding of the molecular basis of mammalian kidney morphogenesis. To date this has depended upon population based-profiling of non-homogenous cellular compartments. In order to improve our resolution of individual cell transcriptional profiles during kidney morphogenesis, we have performed 10x Chromium single cell RNA-seq on over 6000 cells from the E18.5 developing mouse kidney, as well as more than 7000 cells from human iPSC-derived kidney organoids. We identified 16 clusters of cells representing all major cell lineages in the E18.5 mouse kidney. The differentially expressed genes from individual murine clusters were then used to guide the classification of 16 cell clusters within human kidney organoids, revealing the presence of distinguishable stromal, endothelial, nephron, podocyte and nephron progenitor populations. Despite the congruence between developing mouse and human organoid, our analysis suggested limited nephron maturation and the presence of off target populations in human kidney organoids, including unidentified stromal populations and evidence of neural clusters. This may reflect unique human kidney populations, mixed cultures or aberrant differentiation in vitro. Analysis of clusters within the mouse data revealed novel insights into progenitor maintenance and cellular maturation in the major renal lineages and will serve as a roadmap to refine directed differentiation approaches in human iPSC-derived kidney organoids.},

The utility of this protocol for applications such as disease modelling will rely implicitly on the developmental accuracy of the model, technical robustness of the protocol and transferability between iPSC lines. Here we report extensive transcriptional analyses of the sources of variation across the timecourse of differentiation from pluripotency to complete kidney organoid, focussing on repeated differentiations to day 18 organoid. Individual organoids generated within the same differentiation experiment show Spearmans correlation coefficients of {\textgreater}0.99. The greatest source of variation was seen between experimental batch, with the enrichment for genes that also varied temporally between day 10 and day 25 organoids implicating nephron maturation as contributing to transcriptional variance between individual differentiation experiments. A morphological analysis revealed a transition from renal vesicle to capillary loop stage nephrons across the same time period. Distinct iPSC clones were also shown to display congruent transcriptional programs with inter-experimental and inter-clonal variation most strongly associated with nephron patterning. Even epithelial cells isolated from organoids showed transcriptional alignment with total organoids of the same day of differentiation. This data provides a framework for managing experimental variation, thereby increasing the utility of this approach for personalised medicine and functional genomics.},

	abstract = {Precise measurement of cellularity within bioartificial tissues and extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds is necessary to augment rigorous characterization of cellular behavior, as accurate benchmarking of tissue function to cell number allows for comparison of data across experiments and between laboratories. Resazurin, a soluble dye that is reduced to highly fluorescent resorufin in proportion to the metabolic activity of a cell population, is a valuable, noninvasive tool to measure cell number. We investigated experimental conditions in which resazurin reduction is a reliable indicator of cellularity within three-dimensional (3D) ECM scaffolds. Using three renal cell populations, we demonstrate that correlation of viable cell numbers with the rate of resorufin generation may deviate from linearity at higher cell densities, lower resazurin working volumes, or longer incubation times that all contribute to depleting the pool of resazurin. In conclusion, while the resazurin reduction assay provides a powerful, noninvasive readout of metrics enumerating cellularity and growth within ECM scaffolds, assay conditions may strongly influence its applicability for accurate quantification of cell number. The approach and methodological recommendations presented herein may be used as a guide for application-specific optimization of this assay to obtain rigorous and accurate measurement of cellular content in bioengineered tissues.},

increased distance between Gli1+ pericytes and endothelial cells after AKI (mean6 SEM: 3.360.1 mm before injury versus 12.560.2 mm after injury; P,0.001). Using a genetic ablation model, we asked whether pericyte loss alone is sufficient for capillary destabilization. Ten days after pericyte ablation, we observed endothelial cell damage by electron microscopy. Furthermore, pericyte loss led to significantly reduced capillary number at later time points (mean6SEM capillaries/high-power field: 67.664.7 in
control versus 44.164.8 at 56 days; P,0.05) and increased cross-sectional area (mean6

The implications of these findings for the directed differentiation of hPSCs into the kidney include the mechanism of the intermediate mesoderm specification and its patterning along with anteroposterior axis. Using this knowledge, we previously reported successful generation of hPSCs-derived kidney organoids that contained all renal components and modelled human kidney development in vitro.

As evidence of functional maturity, proximal tubules within organoids display megalin-mediated and cubilin-mediated endocytosis, and they respond to a nephrotoxicant to undergo apoptosis.
